00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.049
Now, that we've connected to our data source,

00:00:02.049 --> 00:00:04.029
and for this part of the lesson I'll be using

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.915
the Google Analytics data from the demo account of the Google merchandise store.

00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:10.780
You can see that that's a name that I've given to the report.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.359
You could make your report

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.629
name anything that you like just as you can't with other Google Docs.

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:21.445
But it's time to explore some of the chart options that are available in Data Studio.

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:25.359
I've got a single page report setup here with some different charts on it.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.129
This there's our finished product for today,

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:31.144
but we're going to erase it all so that we can go back through and set it up together.

00:00:31.144 --> 00:00:33.685
It's just as easy as selecting and deleting,

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:35.245
this is important to remember,

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:37.239
so that if you are going through and working

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.270
on something and you don't like how it's turning out,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.055
it's just as easily as selecting and deleting to get rid of it.

00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:46.700
All right. So, now we're going to focus on the 11 types of charts,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.429
that are native to date of studio.

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.715
Each of them is represented by a corresponding button up on this toolbar,

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:57.755
and also appears as a choice from the insert menu at the top of the page.

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:01.170
The 11 types of charts are;

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.109
time series, bar chart,

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:06.989
combo chart, pie chart,

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:11.280
table, geo map, scorecard,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.405
scatter and bubble, bullet chart,

00:01:15.405 --> 00:01:18.855
area chart, and pivot table.

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:21.680
Before we look more closely at some of these charts

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.920
and walk through drafting some of them on a report page,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.820
I want to call your attention to an element that I'd like to add first,

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.154
and that is the date range control.

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:32.974
You see this button right here if we go ahead and click it.

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:34.998
I like to add the date range control,

00:01:34.998 --> 00:01:38.030
because it allows us to adjust the time span for each of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.405
the metrics that aren't already governed by their own date range selector,

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.700
and gives us a chance to play with the data as

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.234
we're working with it to see if it makes sense to us.

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:49.400
When you're done, it's also going to give others who get access to

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.605
your report a typically desirable way to interact with the data too.

00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:55.850
So, here we are in the edit view,

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.209
and we're just going to click on the date range selector.

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.269
You can see that our cursor changes to a cross here,

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:05.899
it's asking us to draw where we want that to be.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.990
I usually put mine at the top right of the page,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.930
because it imitates the Google Analytics interface,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.115
it's familiar to a lot of people and they typically understand exactly what it is.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:20.490
Now, in the date range property panel over here,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.275
we're going to go ahead and just give it a generic date range.

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:33.365
Let's just say third through 16th of June,

00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:35.260
we'll go ahead and hit apply.

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.125
That's just what we're starting,

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:40.504
you'll be able to see if we go over here and click to view,

00:02:40.504 --> 00:02:44.329
that we have a very familiar interface that we can work

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.580
with in where we're view mode and even when weren't edit mode as well.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.185
Now, this looks a little bit small,

00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:54.495
so I'm going to click over on style.

00:02:54.495 --> 00:02:58.460
I want the picker to be a little bit bigger,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.844
let's go ahead and make it 18.

00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:02.830
Let's make it 24.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.325
I think that looks a lot better,

00:03:05.324 --> 00:03:08.479
and we can meet that up a little bit they're.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.715
Perfect. Okay. Now back to our charts.

00:03:11.715 --> 00:03:15.034
In important consideration is that each chart,

00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:18.004
let's just go ahead and look at geo map.

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:21.819
For example. We're going to just do a quick drop of this.

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.269
It's going to come with its own defaults set up over here.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.870
So, it's going to default to country ISO view,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.634
as dimension, it's going to default to sessions as a metric,

00:03:33.634 --> 00:03:35.614
and the zoom area as the world.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.390
It is pretty unlikely that those defaults are

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.494
going to meet your needs without any customization but you.

00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:43.250
As you've heard in other lessons,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.030
and you've experienced with your projects so far don't be afraid to get

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.050
in and test out all the fantastic options that are available to you,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.465
until you find out what works best.

00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:57.120
All right. This has served it's illustrative purposes,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.819
so we're going to go ahead and get rid of it.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.819
One of the most simple charts that you can use,

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.949
which because of its simplicity tends to lend

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.489
some pretty good impact is called the scorecard.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.575
It displays a summary of a single metric based on the date selected.

00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:16.909
It's often used for things like KPIs and other numbers that really need to stand out.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.385
But again, we're talking about individual values.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:24.115
We're going to set one up today to report revenue.

00:04:24.115 --> 00:04:25.980
Again, we click the button,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.095
we make the box,

00:04:28.095 --> 00:04:30.740
and here we have the defaults.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.665
This is defaulting with the metric of sessions,

00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:35.585
the date range is auto,

00:04:35.584 --> 00:04:37.189
which is where we're going to keep it with.

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:38.629
But this actually does is make sure,

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:44.219
that the chart is going to be listening for its date cues from here.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.470
But, we've got to go ahead and change this metric.

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:54.244
You see that when we click on it were brought to the metric picker,

00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:57.709
we're going to scroll down to e-commerce,

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:00.964
and we're going to find revenue.

00:05:00.964 --> 00:05:02.719
I have a habit of rolling right past it,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.355
it did not do that today.

00:05:04.355 --> 00:05:06.170
We're going to select it, and you can see that it's

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.495
working it's actually pulling the data for this date,

00:05:08.495 --> 00:05:10.730
and in this circumstance,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.745
it's giving us a total.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:15.634
Now, where do we want to place it on the page?

00:05:15.634 --> 00:05:19.295
Revenue often referred to as the bottom line.

00:05:19.295 --> 00:05:23.905
Let's go ahead and put it near the bottom of the page for today.

00:05:23.904 --> 00:05:29.009
There we go, click off and then just as a quick little test,

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.625
you want to go in and adjust the date range,

00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:35.870
and make sure that the revenue adjusts and it does

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.495
you know that these two things are talking to each other and listening to each other.

00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:43.819
Typically, the response is going to be that's cool,

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:45.094
but it's not enough.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.420
A really common question that follows when we know

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.580
how much revenue is for certain amount of time is.

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:52.789
What did it look like over different days during that period of time,

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.450
say from June third to June ninth of 2018?

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.865
Well, we have another chart called the time series chart,

00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:04.775
and that is going to be our best bet to answer a question like this.

00:06:04.774 --> 00:06:07.879
Let's go ahead and select it.

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:09.949
I always tend to make these big,

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.985
and you can always make them smaller later, and we're going to draw it here.

00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:19.400
Again, this is coming with its own defaults over here.

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:23.179
It is doing a date and it is doing sessions over that date.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.740
Now, these two things aren't going to work for our needs today.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.000
So, we're gonna go ahead and change them.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.879
Specifically, it's the metric that we want to change.

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:36.379
We're really not interested in sessions,

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:39.094
we are interested again in revenue.

00:06:39.095 --> 00:06:41.295
Let's go ahead and click that,

00:06:41.295 --> 00:06:43.009
and here we go.

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:50.439
Now we've got a visual of how revenue trended over this a date range.

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:52.449
Here we're going to go back,

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.610
because I don't think this is quite informative enough,

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.560
and we can do some things to make it more informative.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.629
If we click on style,

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:09.305
we can tell it to show the data points and even show the data labels.

00:07:09.305 --> 00:07:12.019
This doesn't clutter the chart too much and gives

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:14.719
us more information without having to look

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.560
over at the X and Y axes each time to figure out what it is.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.079
One more time we're going to go through and we're going to change this.

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:26.750
Make sure that everything is clicking.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.160
It does, you can see the big differences and variation.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.930
So, with just these two elements,

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.345
we've started to answer some common questions about

00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:37.750
Google Merchandise store revenue for this time period.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.660
But as is always the case,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.220
answers we get more questions.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.930
So, if someone just asks.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.030
What was our product category breakdown for sales during that same period of time,

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:49.250
wanting to know which product categories were performing?

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.939
Well, of course we have got a chart for that too,

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:57.310
and for that we're going to go to the pie chart.

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:01.355
Again, go ahead and find it at home make it big.

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:04.999
As matter of fact, this is a good time for us to dynamically

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:10.010
resize a few things to make some more room.

00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:13.685
I don't want to be able to read these labels nice and clearly.

00:08:13.685 --> 00:08:16.564
As you can see, the chart as

00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:20.120
provided with defaults does not answer the questions that we had hoped.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.074
When go ahead now and change the dimension,

00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:28.639
there's going to be a content grouping for product categories,

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:34.580
we're going to select that and it's not sessions that we're interested in, its revenue.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.754
So we will go back to e-commerce.

00:08:36.754 --> 00:08:39.240
Go back to revenue,

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.215
and now the chart tells us the answer

00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:47.509
in some regards to the question that we were asked which is.

00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:52.789
How are our product category is performing again during this same period of time?

00:08:52.789 --> 00:08:57.769
If we change the time we are going to see that the mix changes.

00:08:57.769 --> 00:09:01.189
Sometimes it takes a little bit more of

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.685
a dramatic change to change the mix significantly,

00:09:04.684 --> 00:09:09.719
especially, if you have Nest really performed well that week.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:15.250
You can see how with just these few items we have been able to ask questions,

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.320
get answers, and generate more questions.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.700
This is the very nature of what were intended to do with Google Analytics,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.900
and how we use Google Data Studio to help us present our data.

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.639
What I encourage you to do,

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:31.429
is to go ahead and give a try to any or all of

00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:35.734
the other charts that we didn't have time or space to get into today.

00:09:35.735 --> 00:09:39.259
See which ones apply best to your reporting needs.
