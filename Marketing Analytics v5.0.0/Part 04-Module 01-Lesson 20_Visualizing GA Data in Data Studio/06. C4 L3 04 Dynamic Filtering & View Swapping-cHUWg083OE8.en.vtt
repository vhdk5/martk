00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
No overview of Data Studio would be complete without

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.019
looking into two more powerful key features of the product,

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.765
filter control and data control.

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:12.765
Remember how in your work in Google Analytics,

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:16.289
you learned to enhance the built-in reports using filters to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.964
narrow the scope of the data you are working in either for display,

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:22.500
comparison, or further exploration?

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.934
That same functionality exists in Data Studio.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.019
The ability to filter your data.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.644
It also allows you to enhance and build interactivity into your dashboards and reports.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:36.590
Similarly, you've created multiple views in

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.500
Google Analytics either for particular domains,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.024
internal audiences and for implementation purposes.

00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:46.670
Well, Data Studio was built so that you can apply

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.630
your charts and filters to other views on the fly, potentially,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.170
saving you time in creating additional dashboards from scratch

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.775
and further enabling data visualization across your organization.

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:03.649
Both the filter control and data control are easily added and configured,

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.989
similar to the work that we've done with charts.

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:09.920
So let's get started by heading back into the interface and updating

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.570
the sample dashboard for

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:15.819
the Google merchandise store demo account that we've been working on.

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:20.019
As you can see, I've taken the liberty of tidying this up just a bit,

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:23.289
mostly just to make space for the two controls we're about to add.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.690
Just like charts, you can add these controls anywhere on the page.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.649
But I've cleared out some room at the top for ours.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.410
We're going to begin by adding the filter control.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.409
One of the more common filter controls allows you to

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.530
filter the data in your charts by device type,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.795
desktop, mobile and tablet.

00:01:40.795 --> 00:01:43.045
We're going to go ahead and add this one here.

00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:46.750
We begin by selecting filter control from the toolbar,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.155
dragging to draw and letting go.

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:53.814
Now we're going to put this one at the top here and we

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:56.804
don't know yet if we're going to put it in the middle or on the side,

00:01:56.805 --> 00:01:58.515
but we will figure that out after.

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:00.439
Just like our charts, when we draw this,

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.609
it comes pre-populated with other choices,

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.959
so we need to go in and tell it what we want it to filter.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.875
Our dimension here is source,

00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:09.185
that's not what we want.

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:15.650
We want ours to be device type that lives under platformer device,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.905
device category. There we go.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:20.390
Now as soon as you click it,

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.269
you'll see that the label changes on the interface letting you know that

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.719
it has heard you and it's ready to make that change for you.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.599
Let's go back now and look at the metric.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.504
The metric here says sessions.

00:02:31.504 --> 00:02:33.079
We know that that's not what we want.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.150
This chart has been about revenue and we want to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.550
go ahead and continue to make it about revenue.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.090
So we're going to go ahead,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.129
add, get that right on e-commerce, revenue.

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.909
Now, once we think it's done, which is now,

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.174
we're going to go back into view mode and make sure that it's working.

00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:53.660
So what should it do?

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:01.939
What it should do is allow us to select tablet and mobile and desktop in any combination.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.064
Any one individually, any two at a time, or all three at a time,

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:08.689
and then based on that filter,

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.780
reflect changes in our charts.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.629
This right now is defaulted to showing all three.

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.634
Looks like tablet is the least amount of revenue,

00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:21.949
mobile next and the vast majority of sales are on desktop.

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.174
Let's look at mobile by itself.

00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:27.740
Excellent. And you can see that all of our charts have

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.480
updated and now are reflecting data based on this filter.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.574
We can go ahead and add mobile and tablet.

00:03:35.574 --> 00:03:37.609
Doesn't make a huge change but again,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.415
you can see that it's working dynamically.

00:03:40.414 --> 00:03:42.919
We're going to go back into edit mode,

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.139
I didn't think I left quite enough room.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.199
So we're going to make this just a tad smaller and for now,

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.989
we're going to put it in the middle and you can see that we can

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.990
drag it and drop it and make it approximately the same size.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.450
We can go into here and look at our style and see that we have the font set to 18.

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:04.389
We can go into here and also set the font to 18.

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.804
And now, we've got this little space left on the top left.

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:09.230
Now adding the data control,

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:12.274
is even more straight forward than adding the filter control.

00:04:12.275 --> 00:04:14.705
You select it from the menu,

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:18.275
drag it to draw and let go.

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:20.959
Over here, you can see that it's already honed

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.659
in on our connector type which is Google Analytics.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.900
We're going to go ahead and just drag it approximately where we think we want

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:31.069
it and go back into view mode and see what happens.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.170
Now, if we click this arrow,

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.069
it should show us all of the views that we have access to in this property, and it does.

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.189
So we can go ahead and say, "Alright.

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:42.469
We've been working in the master view,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.750
let's see if there's anything different in

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.600
the raw data view for any filters have been applied."

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.550
And you can see that this isn't configured to show us

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.150
any significant changes and I don't

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:54.024
think anything spent on the test view either, but that's okay.

00:04:54.024 --> 00:04:55.599
When you're using this,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.750
go ahead and check a few of the different views that you have access

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.360
to to make sure that the changes are being reflected on your charts.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.895
Adding filter and view controls,

00:05:05.894 --> 00:05:09.745
is just another way to leverage the flexibility of Data Studio.

00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:13.149
Combined with the chart types and style options available,

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:16.189
you've become empowered to create your own dashboard

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.548
either based on the Google merchandise store demo account,

00:05:19.548 --> 00:05:21.814
or your own analytics account.

00:05:21.814 --> 00:05:23.719
But before you do that,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.760
let's finish this lesson by comparing and

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.180
contrasting the two dashboard options you now have,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.910
the one that's native inside of Google Analytics and Data Studio.
