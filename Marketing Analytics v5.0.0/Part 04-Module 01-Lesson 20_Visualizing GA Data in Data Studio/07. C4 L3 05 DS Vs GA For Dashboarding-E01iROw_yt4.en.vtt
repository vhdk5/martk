00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
This level of customization that you can see over here

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.210
on the right doesn't exist in Google Analytics. We get that.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:11.550
But maybe, you really like the clean and consistent look of the GA reports,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.710
is your go-to for reporting.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.540
Maybe, with a little bit of time,

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.074
you've just become really comfortable in them.

00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:22.140
Remember though, that you still have the data clutter and noise concerns

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.130
to navigate every time you want to display the answer to a new question.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:28.079
You've got to find it,

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.719
then you've got to try and isolate it,

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.699
and then you've got to try to present it,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.320
and those can really be a challenge in Google Analytics itself.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.469
Remember too, that just because you're comfortable being

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.589
surrounded by all of the data points in Google Analytics,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.900
don't make the mistake of assuming that everyone you

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.019
want to share your data with will be comfortable too.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.480
If you find yourself doing work for other people who

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:54.589
want very specific answers to specific questions,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.075
Google Analytics is probably not the interface to provide those solutions.

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:01.250
Now, while there are many benefits to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.129
customizing your visuals as we've mentioned earlier,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.120
there are two caveats to consider and one of them we've actually illustrated here.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.484
The first is the bad visual design,

00:01:10.484 --> 00:01:13.094
can provide a poor user experience.

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:15.090
Take a quick look at this chart.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.534
You can see that we've got too many data points to have these labels applied.

00:01:19.534 --> 00:01:22.340
If you were just to leave that as is,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.500
people are going to get confused and frustrated.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.944
So, you have to make sure that you either reduce the number of

00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:30.439
data points so that you change the display label,

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.420
maybe removing the decimal points for example,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.950
to try to clean that up.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.829
Poor user experience can distract from the story

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.024
that you're trying to tell if you do it carelessly.

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:42.180
But it can also provide you,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.270
as the report maker,

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.739
with a distraction that takes away from making

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:49.309
the decisions on what data to include and how to display it.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.250
You can get so busy trying to make something pretty that you

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.939
forget or lose track of whether that something is what's really important.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.709
Don't get caught in that trap.

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:58.849
As we said earlier,

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.188
select your data points first,

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:05.889
get plain looking versions of your charts up there as we have done,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.909
and then once you're happy that the data being displayed is the data you want,

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.939
then go ahead and click on each of your reports,

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.359
turn to the design and style aspects over here,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.450
and make them look the way we want.

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.549
Now, as we close up this examination of

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.590
the relative strengths and weaknesses of

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.110
Google Analytics and Data Studios for your reporting,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.995
and dashboarding needs, there's one last consideration to be made.

00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:35.210
The power of your data lies in sharing it with others.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.515
So, let's talk a little bit about sharing the results of your hard work.

00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:45.759
Sharing in Data Studio is just as simple as sharing in any other Google Doc.

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.745
You go over here,

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:49.730
click on the Plus to share the report,

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:55.429
and this is a very familiar interface for any of you who've used Google products before.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.979
You can share with individual emails or addresses,

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.080
you can go ahead and create a shareable link,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.265
and then you can determine what can people who have that link do,

00:03:04.264 --> 00:03:07.199
can they edit, can they just view in any event?

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:11.359
It's a very clean and familiar process to share things.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.580
It's important because the right data in

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.600
the right hands is where insight and innovation occur.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.659
This approach that you're seeing here is really part of the democratization of

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.370
data that can make organizational buying broad and effective.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.500
Now, if we go over and we compare that to the approach that we have to take here,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.414
which is that in order to share your reports,

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:39.424
you have to grant someone at least view access to

00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:42.110
your Analytics just to show them

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.410
the few metrics and dimensions that might be of importance to them.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.689
This is not the best way to do things.

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.960
It's rarely the best approach for empowering staff or

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.349
anyone who doesn't want to have to learn another interface.

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.334
Casual users don't want to learn how to navigate

00:03:57.334 --> 00:04:01.009
only to find those few things that are really important to them.

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:05.449
Keep all of these things in mind and act on working to ensure that

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:10.218
whoever you're providing and sharing your data with is going to have the easiest,

00:04:10.218 --> 00:04:13.210
cleanest, clearest journey possible.
