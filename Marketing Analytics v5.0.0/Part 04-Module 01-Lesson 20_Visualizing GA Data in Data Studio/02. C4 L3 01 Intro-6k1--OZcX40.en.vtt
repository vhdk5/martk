00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
Even once you've mastered the built-in reports and

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.129
dashboards that Google Analytics offers,

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.980
you will run into situations where you just can't find the right

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.640
visual to drive home the impact of a discovery you've just made.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.530
You may find yourself being asked to

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.500
present data to a different audience than you have in the past.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.509
Maybe an audience that's more or less

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.540
technical than the team members you're used to connecting with.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.599
Or maybe, you really want to wow,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.109
one of your clients by providing them a dashboard and reports,

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.045
with custom branded components,

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:31.790
like their unique logo and brand colors.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.409
You've got options for these situations.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.819
Because in addition to the features offered in Google Analytics,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.759
Google also offers a dedicated product designed to help you

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:44.994
generate and present data in visually interesting and appealing ways.

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:47.354
That product is Data Studio.

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:50.299
It provides tremendous flexibility to design and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:53.584
generate live data through reports and dashboards.

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:57.910
In this lesson, you'll learn how to connect the data source and data studio,

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.484
use it to populate various types of charts,

00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:03.155
and swap views for your Google Analytics.

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:05.900
We'll also cover the advantages and drawbacks of

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.330
dashboarding in Google Analytics and Data Studio.

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.594
So, you'll have a good understanding of when to use which tool.

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:15.950
It might sound a bit overwhelming, but don't worry.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.615
Once you've connected a Google Analytics data source to Data Studio,

00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:20.844
which we'll cover next,

00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:23.539
the interface makes it easy for you to proceed

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.170
regardless of how much experience you do or don't have.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.094
There are multiple options to spark your creativity,

00:01:30.093 --> 00:01:34.444
including, starting a new report from scratch on a clean white background,

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:37.323
using or adopting one of the templates provided,

00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:43.509
and even looking at reports in a gallery where other users have uploaded their works.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.480
Of course, once you've created a masterpiece that communicates just the way you want to,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.420
you're not going to want anyone felling it up.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.685
Right? Google has you covered.

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:54.710
Because your reports and dashboards,

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.359
can be shared with others with varying levels of permission.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.153
Sometimes, you'll want to grant users only the option to view your reports,

00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:07.204
but other times you want to empower users with the option to engage the data,

00:02:07.204 --> 00:02:09.590
maybe by altering a date range including

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.770
a custom dimension or applying a filter or segment.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.780
You'll be able to accomplish all of this and more.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.305
Next, we'll get started by connecting

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:22.215
a data source to provide the data for your reports and dashboards.

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:25.710
Before we do that, just a quick note about something.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.705
You'll notice that Google refers to Data Studio as being in beta,

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:31.445
don't let that concern you.

00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:33.799
It has more to do with ongoing development

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.210
at upgrades that are constantly being pushed out,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.985
rather than to a level of incompleteness or a lack of polish.

00:02:39.985 --> 00:02:43.745
Remember how long Google considered Gmail as being in beta,

00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:46.564
it's a similar thing with Data Studio.

00:02:46.564 --> 00:02:51.384
You may even see some features tagged with a little red label that says labs.

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:53.454
Just like in the old gmail beta,

00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:56.000
these are the newest features under development.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.324
There are also other ways to see what's new,

00:02:58.324 --> 00:03:00.349
that we'll also get into shortly.
