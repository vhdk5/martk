00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
As we mentioned in our overview Data Studio contains

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.835
numerous reports and chart types and plenty of templates to get you started.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:12.540
What it doesn't know until you tell it is where it's going to

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.974
get the data needed to populate those reports and charts.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.855
A process for this is pretty straightforward.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:24.255
Google's own helped document is an excellent source to refer back to if needed.

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:26.879
But for now, from the homepage of

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:30.299
the Data Studio interface unless you've already done this before,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.700
you'll see that there are no reports built.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.410
There's a big prompt at the center of the screen urging you to start here.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:42.069
You can do that but you can also just click over on data sources.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.600
Again, Google knows that you haven't done this

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.840
before and is urging you to create a data source.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.490
To do this you can click on

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.945
the big blue button on the bottom right hand side of the screen.

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:55.700
Depending on your access levels and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.460
whether or not you've been through this before there are any number

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.795
of screens that could come up that you would lead to complete in order to proceed.

00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:06.590
Go ahead here and click on Get Started.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.969
Google is asking you here if you're using this for personal use or for business.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.650
Considering that you're doing this as

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.120
an educational endeavor I would go ahead and leave the company name blank.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.000
You do of course always have to scroll all the way

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.834
down and acknowledge that you've read and agree to Google's terms of service.

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:27.994
Go ahead and hit "Accept".

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:31.555
Here Google is asking your preferences in terms of,

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:32.985
do you want some tips?

00:01:32.984 --> 00:01:34.799
Do you want product announcements?

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.929
Do you want market research or offers?

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.340
I get a lot of these e-mails from a bunch of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.460
other instances of Google products that I use.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.544
So, for now I'm going to click no.

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:47.890
Then I'm going to click done.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.739
Now, it's saying okay.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.039
Go ahead and continue with your previous action.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.305
In other words Google's ready for you now.

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:57.155
Go ahead and hit the big blue button again.

00:01:57.155 --> 00:02:03.335
Here we are at a page that is going to list for us three different kinds of connectors.

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:05.089
Starting at the top,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.520
you'll see the Google connectors which are built and

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:10.430
maintained by Google as part of Data Studio.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.319
This is where you'll find the Google Analytics connector that we'll be using.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.805
Take a quick moment to look at the rest of the connectors in this set.

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:25.159
You'll notice a number of Google's other products in here including BigQuery,

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.375
double click campaign manager, YouTube Analytics.

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:32.000
We won't be using any of them in this course but it's

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
important to know that they're here and that the connection between

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.969
those datasets and Data Studio's is going to be made in

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.004
the same way as we are about to demonstrate for Google Analytics.

00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:46.370
The next category is somehow larger and shows partner connectors.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.830
You'll see that Google is saying that these are built in

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.805
supported by Data Studio partners.

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:55.550
So, much longer list and you will of course see some brands of

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.110
note and some others that you may not know as you scroll through the list.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.770
What you need to take away from this list is that Data Studio is

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.460
meant to be used for more than just website and mobile Analytics,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.740
which is a demonstration of its flexibility but also provides one of its drawbacks

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.409
namely that there may be a great deal of

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.159
functionality that will be unfamiliar to you here as you begin.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.049
That's okay. For now,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.740
we're just going to focus on what we're going to accomplish with Analytics.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.960
Remember that there are other capabilities in

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.719
this tool that might be helpful for you down the road.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:33.754
The last category of connectors as we continue through

00:03:33.754 --> 00:03:37.669
all of the partner ones are called the Open Source connectors.

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:42.004
They're built by members of the Data Studio open source community.

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:45.829
For this set of connectors and the one that came before it,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.065
it's important to note some things.

00:03:48.064 --> 00:03:50.270
Google is going to tell you at the bottom of

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.530
this page and these connectors are not provided by them,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.129
supported by them and then make no promises or commitments about

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.129
the performance quality or content of the services in the applications that are provided.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.299
Second, some of these connectors have been monetized by their creators.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.210
Meaning there's a fee involved for using them.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.099
Because of these two caveat,

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.180
it's recommended you not use any third party connectors unless

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.925
your client is expressed the willing to do so and does so knowing

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:23.030
that they need to rely on support for that connector to come from

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:27.744
the third party that's developed it and pay any associated costs for its use.

00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:31.310
For now, let's head back to the top of the list and

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.865
locate the Google connector for Google Analytics.

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:38.465
Hover over it and then click "Select".

00:04:38.464 --> 00:04:41.424
The next few clicks will take you through some permission screens.

00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:43.079
Again if you've done this before,

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:45.514
you may or may not see any or all of them.

00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:47.224
You have been here before.

00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:49.895
You'll need to complete all of these steps.

00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:52.384
Go ahead and click authorize.

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:56.240
Google is saying that it wants to access your Google account in order to

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.840
make this happen and is telling you that Google's studio,

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:03.574
Data Studio will need to view your Google Analytics data.

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:05.894
Go ahead and click allow.

00:05:05.894 --> 00:05:11.674
From here, let's hover over the Google Analytics connector and hit select.

00:05:11.675 --> 00:05:14.764
On the bottom left of the screen you'll see a list

00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:17.974
of the Google Analytics accounts that you have access to.

00:05:17.975 --> 00:05:22.879
If you're working with your own data or the data of a website or

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:27.680
a mobile app from a customer or a client and you have access to it,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.865
it should appear here.

00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:31.400
If you've already gone ahead and gained access to

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:35.495
the Google merchandise store demo account which we've used earlier in the Nanodegree.

00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:37.519
It should also appear here.

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:40.069
Go ahead and click on the demo account.

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.250
Now, it's going to ask you which property within that account.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.769
The Google merchandise store only has one.

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:47.344
We will select that.

00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:49.725
Now, it's asking you which view.

00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:52.720
Because when working in Data Studio we don't run

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.605
the danger of overriding any data in Google Analytics.

00:05:56.605 --> 00:06:00.730
We're going to go ahead and do our report based on the master view.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.470
Go ahead and select that as well.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.500
Now, all that is waiting for us to do is click connect.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.220
What we have here is an index.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.535
Right now Google has gone ahead and using the connector it has demonstrated a list

00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:25.375
for us of all of the fields available in the Google Analytics account,

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:31.300
property and view that we selected and is assigning them a field name,

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.410
a type, whether or not aggregation is active and finally description.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.045
There's no report here.

00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:41.074
We haven't done anything yet to generate a report.

00:06:41.074 --> 00:06:45.514
Right now we know that our Google connector has worked and that

00:06:45.514 --> 00:06:47.870
Data Studio is now going to be pulling

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.995
data from the Google Analytics account that we set up.

00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:54.199
Next, we'll take a look at some different kinds of charts we can

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:58.599
populate using some of the fields that we're just mapped through the connector.
