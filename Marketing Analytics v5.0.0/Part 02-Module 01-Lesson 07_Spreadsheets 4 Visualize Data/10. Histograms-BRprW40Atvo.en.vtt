00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.339
A Histogram is a column chart that measures the frequency of data in

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.434
a data set and specifically groups numerical values into bins, we define.

00:00:10.435 --> 00:00:12.839
Recall that we previously created

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.390
a column chart to compare counts of categories within a data set.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.815
This kind of chart answers a question like,

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:25.145
how many players are there in each playing position in the league?

00:00:25.144 --> 00:00:27.884
But what if we want to ask the question,

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:31.260
how many players made under $1 million in salary,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.000
and between $1 and $2 million,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.774
and between $2 and $3 million in salary, et cetera?

00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:39.359
This kind of a chart is a histogram,

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.880
and the groupings we choose such as,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.830
all salaries between $1 and $2 million and salaries between $2 and $3 million

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.239
are the bins.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.000
There are two ways to do this in Excel.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.049
We'll start with a method that works on both Windows and

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:01.074
Mac using the histogram tool in the analysis tool pack add-in.

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:03.910
Instructions for loading the analysis tool pack

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.054
add-in are given in the Getting Started instructions.

00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:15.765
The second way is a simple insert chart method available for Excel 2016 for PC.

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:17.469
I'll show you that too.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.010
The tool pack histogram requires two columns of data.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.920
One for data you want to analyze and one for

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.215
bin levels that represent the intervals for the bins.

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:29.409
In this example, I'm starting at $1 million,

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.060
then $2 million, et cetera,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.990
up to $15 million.

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:34.599
When I create the histogram,

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.849
the number of values in the salaries lists that are

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:39.804
below $1 million will be in the first bin.

00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:44.905
The numbers of salaries between $1 and $2 million will be in the second bin, and so on.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:46.625
To create the histogram,

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:52.390
choose data analysis from the data menu on Windows or from the tools menu on Mac.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.480
Choose histogram, which opens a dialog.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.295
For the input range,

00:01:57.295 --> 00:02:00.234
select the data from the salaries column.

00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:01.569
For the bin range,

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.464
select the bin intervals you've created.

00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:09.325
If you have a label at the top of your columns as I do here, click labels.

00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:10.719
For the output options,

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.310
select new worksheet and chart output,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.659
and press OK. Excel will analyze

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.284
the list and create a count for the bins on a new worksheet,

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:26.405
and then create a column chart to match it.

00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:32.689
The second method is only available in Excel 2016 on Windows.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.509
Just select your data and click insert,

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:39.004
recommended charts and choose the histogram chart.

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.530
To configure details about the bins,

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.272
right click the horizontal axis of the chart,

00:02:44.272 --> 00:02:49.004
click format axis and then click axis options.

00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:53.199
The dialog provides options for choosing categorical data

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:57.284
like the player positions or automatic for numerical data.

00:02:57.284 --> 00:03:02.189
You can specify the number of bins which you might choose to experiment with a bit.

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.409
If you choose bins that are too narrow,

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.085
the result can be noisy.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:10.445
On the other hand, too few bins will hide details.

00:03:10.444 --> 00:03:16.359
Here as always, think about what you're trying to learn and convey about the data,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.430
and use that as your guide for making these determinations.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.629
As with other charts,

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.460
design and layout can be further

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.030
customized from the design menu when the chart is selected.
