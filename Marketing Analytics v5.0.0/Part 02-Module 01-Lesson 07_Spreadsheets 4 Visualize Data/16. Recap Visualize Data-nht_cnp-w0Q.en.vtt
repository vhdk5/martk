Congratulations, you've completed the final lesson on spreadsheets.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.410
I hope you've enjoyed the spreadsheets portion of

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.484
the course as much as I've enjoyed teaching it.

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:12.554
You've come a long way.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:17.009
You've learned to manipulate data sets with all sorts of functions and tools.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.560
You've learned to answer questions about the data,

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:23.849
to analyze the data with aggregation tools and pivot tables.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.020
And finally you learned how to create a number of different charts and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.869
graphs to visualize and present your analysis professionally.

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:39.000
Now you're ready to use spreadsheets in projects and presentations of your own.
