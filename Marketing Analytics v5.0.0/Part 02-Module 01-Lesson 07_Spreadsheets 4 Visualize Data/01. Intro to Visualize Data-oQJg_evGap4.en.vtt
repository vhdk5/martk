00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.349
When we look at spreadsheets and tables full of text and numbers,

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:06.250
it's hard to tell much.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.355
We might notice trends such as,

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.310
gee, there seem to be a lot of pitchers in this list.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.810
And we can create some formulas to find out answers to questions like,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.135
what percentage of the players are pitchers?

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:24.565
Well, now I'm wondering about all the other positions, outfielders, catchers.

00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:29.600
It would be more helpful to see the data in one big picture.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.060
Here's a pie chart of the percentages of all positions from the baseball set.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.025
This is an example of visualizing the data.

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:39.949
When we visualize our data,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.765
we understand it more fully.

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:44.429
And if you're explaining your data analysis to

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.820
someone else who's less familiar with it than you are,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.325
that is especially important.

00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:53.150
When looking at the data as a picture,

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.301
it's easier to notice patterns,

00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:59.280
perhaps, spot trends to examine more closely.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.885
In this lesson, you're going to learn how to make pie charts as well as bar charts,

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:07.530
scatter plots and line graphs from your data.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.875
After learning how to create some of these basic graphs,

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:13.034
you'll learn how to create histograms,

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:17.250
which display the frequency of values in your data, and box plots,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.275
which provide an added glance view of the statistical spread in your data.

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:24.540
As we work through these various charts,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.545
you'll learn some formatting skills that make your charts clear and easy to understand.

00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:33.840
We'll finish the lesson with a little more formatting to really polish

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.775
your skills for producing professional looking charts for data analysis reports.

00:01:39.775 --> 00:01:42.180
You've come a long way in spreadsheets.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.000
This lesson will have some challenges in it but you're ready for them.
