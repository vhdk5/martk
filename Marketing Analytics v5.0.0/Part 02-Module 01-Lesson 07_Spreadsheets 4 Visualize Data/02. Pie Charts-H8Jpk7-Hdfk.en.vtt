00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.344
A pie chart is used to illustrate proportionality.

00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:06.615
If we have a whole group of some sort,

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:11.294
such as a list of all players in a baseball league and their positions,

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:17.240
a pie chart can tell us what percentages of the whole group are in each position.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:20.024
Think of it as slicing the pie into pieces,

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:23.834
where each piece matches a percentage of the whole list.

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:26.789
In spreadsheets this is really easy,

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.954
because all we need is a list of the categories

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:33.634
and matching values such as sums or counts.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:36.239
Select the list of categories and values,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.925
go to the Insert menu and choose the pie chart. There it is.

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:43.320
It might not look quite the way we want yet,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.615
but there are some easy fixes for that too.

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:47.984
When the chart is selected,

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:51.344
a design and format menu are available on the Excel ribbon.

00:00:51.344 --> 00:00:55.015
The design menu gives a number of choices: I'll

00:00:55.015 --> 00:01:00.685
choose this one because I like seeing the percentages on the pie.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:05.900
I can change the chart title to something more useful by editing it.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.200
There's more that you can do to change the appearance of the graph,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.144
but this gets it started.

00:01:11.144 --> 00:01:15.899
We'll go into more detail on how to polish the look later.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.965
For this example I already had a simple list that I highlighted,

00:01:19.965 --> 00:01:25.185
but I could have used the pivot table we created earlier with some careful selection.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.075
Here's the pivot table.

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:32.545
The position categories are in the top row and the totals are in the bottom row.

00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:37.004
Select the categories, then either hold down the control key on Windows,

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:42.959
or the Command key on Apple keyboards to select the bottom row with your mouse.

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.929
It works most reliably to copy these and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.950
then paste this little collection somewhere else.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.240
I'm going to paste using the transpose feature.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.155
So I have columns,

00:01:55.155 --> 00:02:04.281
then select and choose the insert pie chart as before.

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:07.939
We get the exact same thing.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.169
Now it's your turn to explore creating pie charts.
