00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.275
Before we go on to the next type of chart,

00:00:03.275 --> 00:00:06.830
let's take a look at the chart layout options in Excel.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.230
So far, we've used the Chart Design tab that appears when you

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.120
select a chart to choose some pre-made formatted styles.

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.824
Now, I want you to take a look at the Quick Layout menu over here,

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:22.134
and the Add Chart Element menu next to it.

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:24.120
The Quick Layout menu is a set of

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.500
pre-made layouts that affect which chart elements are included and where.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.425
Like the axis labels and the legend.

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:34.755
You can select various ones and see the effect.

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.590
To get really specific about your layout,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.140
look at the Add Chart Element menu.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.420
With this menu, it's possible to add and remove elements of all types from the chart.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.414
There is a lot here,

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.950
and rather than try to learn all of it,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.575
we'll just use some parts as we need them.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:57.880
It's good to know where to find it though, for those times,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.715
when you know what you want to change and

00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:05.170
all those pre-made formats and layouts just don't have what you need.
