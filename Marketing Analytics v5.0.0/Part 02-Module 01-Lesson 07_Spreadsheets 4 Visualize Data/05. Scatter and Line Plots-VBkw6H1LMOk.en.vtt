00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
We use pie and bar charts to visualize categorical data.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.200
If we have a list of numerical data,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.050
such as the list of stock prices over time,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.415
a line chart gives us a better picture of the data set.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:18.449
Here's a table of data I downloaded from a financial website,

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.059
listing prices for AAPL stock.

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.500
It has columns for date, open,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.690
high, low, close, and volume.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.670
I want to select the date column and the close column

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.005
then go to the insert menu and select a line chart.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:40.359
I can move the chart to its own sheet to see the detail better.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.755
The chart is a little plain,

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:47.175
but there are several quick fixes in the chart design menu.

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:52.689
I'll choose one and change the title to AAPL Stock Price.

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:54.185
That was pretty easy.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:56.424
The horizontal axis shows the dates,

00:00:56.424 --> 00:00:59.140
and the vertical axis shows dollar values.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.359
Now I can see, at a glance,

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.209
that over the past year the stock has gone up with a little hiccup about a month ago.

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:09.924
If I have more than one column of data for the same dates,

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:13.359
I can show lines for each on the same chart.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:14.965
I'll use the same data set,

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:19.715
but I'll select the date plus the high and low values for AAPL stock.

00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:22.409
Since the high and low aren't all that far apart,

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.634
I'll also change the range for the dollar amount on the left to start at 100.

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:29.335
Select the vertical axis,

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:32.314
right click, and format axis.

00:01:32.314 --> 00:01:38.420
You can see both the high and low value lines now and see the spreads between them.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.390
There are a lot of ways to change the look of the same line chart by altering the layout.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.310
I could also try to plot two different variables for AAPL stock without dates at all,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.030
such as the closing price and volume.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.269
When I choose the scatterplot,

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:57.509
I get a graph with the closing price on

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.330
the horizontal axis and the volume of trade that day on the vertical axis.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.709
I can see that the prices seem to cluster in a couple of areas and that they have about

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:14.000
the same volume generally though there are some high volume days at the lower price.
