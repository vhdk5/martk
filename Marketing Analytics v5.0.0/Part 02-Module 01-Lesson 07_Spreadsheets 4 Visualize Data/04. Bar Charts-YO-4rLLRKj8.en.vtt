00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
We could use the same information as before and

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.269
choose a bar or column chart instead of a pie chart.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.059
Instead of percentages, it would just show

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.278
the values with longer bars or columns representing larger values.

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:16.170
This puts a little different spin on things.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.840
In this chart, we're comparing

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.789
the category values against each other and we see their relative sizes.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.579
However, we do not have much sense of

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.904
the whole league or the percentage of each category as we did with the pie charts.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:35.490
Choosing which kind of chart to use really depends on

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.359
what patterns you want to highlight and what questions you want to answer.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.664
Use bar or column charts to compare category values with each other.

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:49.829
Those categories could be player positions as shown here or could

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.296
be sales years or could be apples and oranges.

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:59.250
Use a pie chart to show proportionality of categories.
