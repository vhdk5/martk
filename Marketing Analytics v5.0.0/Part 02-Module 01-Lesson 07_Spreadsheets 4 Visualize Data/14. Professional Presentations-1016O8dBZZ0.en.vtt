00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
Excel and other spreadsheet applications can do

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.889
a nice job of creating attractive tables and charts.

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:11.714
It's up to us to make them look their absolute best though.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:13.349
They should be readable,

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.559
interesting and show the required information,

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:21.254
but not show extra information that doesn't matter.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.489
When you present data,

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.829
think about what questions you're trying to

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.219
answer and the patterns you're trying to show,

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:33.030
then use fonts and layouts appropriately to include and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.370
emphasize the elements that matter and exclude elements that don't.

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:42.019
Also, ask yourself who is your audience.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.205
Is this a quick overview presentation on a slide with the data backup elsewhere

00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:53.864
or is it a written technical review where more in-depth data should be presented?

00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:58.859
Let's look at some of the charts we created earlier and see if we can improve upon them.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.604
For categorical column data,

00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:04.200
like the counts of the baseball positions,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:11.460
the relative sizes are easier to see at a glance if the data is sorted by size.

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:14.009
This would not be something we would want to do for

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.500
sequential data like daily stock values or histogram bins,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.829
but it is more readable in this case.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.814
There should be a descriptive title,

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:30.329
so I'll put one in that says baseball positions.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.390
It should also be big enough to read.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.885
If you need to change the font or font size,

00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:44.680
this can be done by selecting the title and changing it in the Home tab.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.954
There, does this chart need a legend?

00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:59.659
If there are more than one data series, it does,

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.819
but if the labels are already showing up in the data as in this pie chart,

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.215
then an extra legend is just noise, so remove it.

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:13.384
For a graph, do you need or want grid lines?

00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:15.947
In a detailed technical presentation,

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:19.485
it is easier to see the values if there are grid lines,

00:02:19.485 --> 00:02:23.675
but for quick overviews that are just emphasizing the trend,

00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:27.050
those extra lines look busy.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.340
What about the axis labels?

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.259
I hate it when I look at a graph and can't tell what the numbers on the axis represent,

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.379
so I would generally say put them there,

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.314
but there are always exceptions.

00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:43.759
If the units are redundant,

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.084
somehow, they can be removed.

00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:51.215
The font size is a judgement call,

00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:55.715
but bigger is easier to read and draws attention.

00:02:55.715 --> 00:03:01.770
So take a look at your chart and see if it can be improved.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.109
Color is a similar issue.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.170
It just depends.

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.259
Keep in mind that your chart may be printed in

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:23.294
grayscale or viewed by someone who's colorblind.

00:03:23.294 --> 00:03:26.189
So if it's possible to distinguish groupings in

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.044
additional ways such as different shapes and scatter plots,

00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:32.354
or using dashes in lines,

00:03:32.354 --> 00:03:36.179
it's a best practice to do so.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.490
The format data series dialogue has

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.425
a number of options for changing the look of your graph.

00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:46.380
This was just a sampling of some of the modifications you can make to

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:52.064
your charts to give them the impact you want in a professional presentation.

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:57.939
The best way to learn is to just try things, to explore.
