00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.644
A box plot, which in our case is really a box and whisker plot,

00:00:04.644 --> 00:00:10.050
is the visualization of statistical spread in a data set of values.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.150
A traditional box plot is built using the five numbers summary.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.867
The five numbers summary consists of five values.

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:23.070
The maximum, the minimum, the 1st quartile,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.225
the 2nd quartile, also called the median,

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.640
and the 3rd quartile.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.329
If we have a list of numbers sorted and divided as

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.890
evenly as possible into fourths, we have the quartiles of data.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.713
Where we make a box and whisker plot,

00:00:40.713 --> 00:00:43.049
the maximum becomes the tip of

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:48.409
the upper whisker and the minimum becomes the tip of the lower whisker.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:55.669
The box represents the middle half of the data with a line where the median is.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.000
Excel will give us a bonus six number in the summary

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.400
by placing an X at the mean or average value of the set.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.430
Creating a box plot in Windows Excel 2016 is as easy as any other chart.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.560
Select columns of data.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.950
Click insert in recommended charts then click the box in whisker chart.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.670
Remember that a box plot represents statistics for a single list of numbers.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.484
So, each list you select will be represented by its own box plot.

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:37.670
The box plot now visually gives a sense of the spread of the value list.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.599
I'll just adjust the range so that I can see the plots a little better.

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:48.579
And, give the chart a title.
