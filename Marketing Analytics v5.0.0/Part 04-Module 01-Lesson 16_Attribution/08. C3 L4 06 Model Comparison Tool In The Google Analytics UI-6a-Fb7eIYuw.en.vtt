00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Let's talk about the model comparison tool in the Google Analytics UI.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.300
This is your opportunity to move away from

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.230
single touch attribution directly within the Google Analytics interface.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.740
The model comparison tool offers several built-in models,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.149
which are last interaction,

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.984
first interaction, last non-direct click,

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.250
which again is the standard GA model.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.684
They have a linear model, position-based, time decay,

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:25.839
and if you are a GA360 customer,

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.254
then you could also use their data-driven attribution model.

00:00:29.254 --> 00:00:32.104
We'll look at all of these in the interface in a moment.

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:35.929
Let's think through what each of these models represents.

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:39.320
The first three continue to be single touch points.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.780
Last interaction is going to give 100 percent of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.814
conversion credit to the last interaction including direct traffic.

00:00:45.814 --> 00:00:49.534
So it's slightly different than the last non-direct click.

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:52.009
First interaction is going to give 100 percent

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.649
of the attribution credit to the first touch point.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.795
Then of course, last non-direct click we've gone into in some detail already.

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:03.609
The linear model will move you into multi-touch attribution.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.010
Linear model will give proportional credit across all

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.460
of the touchpoints within the look-back window for that user.

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:13.504
It will give that credit equally across the touch points

00:01:13.504 --> 00:01:16.774
with no consideration to position or recency.

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:19.580
Position-based model will give a disproportionate amount of

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.429
credit to both the first and the last interaction,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.830
which builds on the assumption that they introducer

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.519
channels and the closer channels are the most important,

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:29.750
and then it's going to give a smaller amount of credit

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.424
proportionally divided to the intermediate touchpoints.

00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:36.500
The time decay model is going to give more credit to

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.900
the most recent touchpoints unless credit going

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.329
back in time to the more distant touch points,

00:01:41.328 --> 00:01:43.744
but it is going to give credit to all of them.

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:46.469
Time decay uses what's called a half-life,

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.025
and the default half-life is seven days.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:51.620
As you go back in time, every seven days,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.710
the conversion credit diminishes by a factor of two.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.369
So let's look at these in the interface briefly just so you can see how to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.600
leverage this functionality to start moving away from a single touch universe.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.194
Within the model comparison tool now,

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:08.034
which is accessible under conversions,

00:02:08.034 --> 00:02:12.500
then the attribution drop-down model comparison tool.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.650
It's going to default to the same settings that we have for

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.340
the multi-channel funnels reports unless we change them.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.865
It's going to also populate the last interaction model as the default.

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:29.210
Because the last non-direct click model is most

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.770
familiar within the Google Analytics context,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.230
let's add that as our basis for comparison.

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:40.399
Then let's start layering in some different models to see

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.500
how different ways of approaching attribution impact conversion credit.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.000
Let's compare last non-direct click to first interaction because it's

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.680
quite different while remembering that these are both single touch models.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.905
This is going to give 100 percent of credit for a given conversion to one-channel.

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:04.210
Let's layer in the position-based Model

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.485
2 because it moves us directly into multi-touch attribution.

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:12.830
You may have noticed that the multi-channel funnels

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.055
channel grouping is going to be the primary dimension by default.

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:18.830
We know that we have customized default channel groupings.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.680
So let's use our own settings here because we want to see

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.224
our channels the way we are used to reporting them.

00:03:26.224 --> 00:03:30.229
The first thing you'll notice is that each model will have columns.

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:34.004
Now, we see last non-direct click attribution,

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:37.594
burst interaction attribution, and position-based attribution.

00:03:37.594 --> 00:03:40.009
I want to see conversions and value.

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.829
I'm interested in revenue and I'm interested in the transaction being driven,

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.665
and I want to see how each model is attributing the changes in conversion value.

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:49.889
So revenue attribution.

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.989
Something that I can see here very clearly display

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.710
gets treated very differently in a first interaction world or in

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.240
a position-based world compared to the last non-direct click

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.250
methodology that people have largely been relying on for the last half decade or more.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.430
As we start to layer in more sophisticated ways of looking at our multi-touch efforts.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.640
From a first interaction perspective,

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.539
still a single touch perspective we can see that display is

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.100
a very strong introducer channel in bringing people into the website.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.060
Thinking in terms of sales funnels,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.050
we can say that display in this scenario is

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.970
a strong upper funnel or top of funnel channel for this advertiser.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.590
It may not be converting after those interactions,

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:35.989
but it is nevertheless responsible for a lot of

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.670
conversion activity and conversion value as a channel.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.129
We can see from the last click standpoint display is credited with

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.969
just under $600 in revenue over a 90 day period.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.340
But from a first interaction standpoint,

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:53.164
it really drove about $84,000 in revenue.

00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:56.335
From a position-based perspective,

00:04:56.334 --> 00:04:58.469
which is a multi-touch perspective,

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.630
the fractional credit is given based on the attribution criteria.

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:07.834
We can see that display is credited with nearly $60,000 in revenue.

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:13.714
This data is suggesting that display is a really valuable channel.

00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:17.239
Another way of looking at it is to say that display is

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.545
undervalued by a last touch perspective.

00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:25.125
Now would be a good opportunity to test that.

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:28.970
Is there room to invest more in display and particularly in

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.920
specific traffic sources or campaigns that are most efficient within display,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.675
that are bringing in those users and fueling the top of your conversion funnel?

00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:41.990
You would want to test this and then measure the results.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.564
If display is as valuable as this change of perspective is suggesting,

00:05:46.564 --> 00:05:50.240
then if you allocate additional percentage of budget,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.675
you should see downstream results.

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:58.850
I just want to point out that a simple shift of perspective from last non-direct click to

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.000
a multi-touch world does have significant impact on

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.420
how given channels or campaigns will receive conversion credit.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.379
This may take some time and effort,

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:12.560
but if the insights you draw from a multi-touch attribution perspective are tested,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.139
you should hypothesize seeing an increase in assisted conversions from display and

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:24.029
a corresponding lift in last click conversions for the channels that display supports.

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.349
When you make the decision to change your marketing budget to invest

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.520
more in an undervalued channel.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:33.709
It's really up to you and your team to

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:36.875
validate the story that these models are telling you.

00:06:36.875 --> 00:06:42.589
This is a good opportunity to discuss that these models can also be customized.

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:46.414
Let's take a look at making customizations.

00:06:46.415 --> 00:06:50.030
We have position-based in place now,

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:53.414
and we can just click on the down arrow,

00:06:53.415 --> 00:06:57.850
and we can make a copy of that model.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:04.820
So the standard model becomes the basis for customization.

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:07.540
The standard position based model is going to get

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.825
40 percent of credit to the first interaction,

00:07:10.824 --> 00:07:13.254
40 percent credit to the last interaction,

00:07:13.254 --> 00:07:19.360
and then 20 percent is going to be divided equally over intermediate interactions.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.600
Look-back window, impression, and engagement

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.320
settings are not going to be used by default,

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:29.860
but here's where customization comes into the mix.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:37.580
Here we can adjust the look-back window to 90 days to account for that long time lag.

00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:40.370
Here, we can adjust the credit for

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:47.209
impressions based on what we know about the overall value of an impression.

00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:53.149
We can also adjust the credit given to a touch point based on the engagement of

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:59.614
that user in the particular session based on time on site or page depth.

00:07:59.615 --> 00:08:04.954
User engagement then becomes a criteria for distributing attribution credit.

00:08:04.954 --> 00:08:09.529
We can also apply some custom rules to our model here based on

00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:15.089
position in the conversion path or a variety of factors.

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:21.125
So if we start with one of these multi-touch models and we begin testing and validating,

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:27.514
we can also start tweaking to see the impacts and try to refine these models to more

00:08:27.514 --> 00:08:29.870
accurately reflect the impact on

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.054
our actual business and what we already know about our business,

00:08:34.054 --> 00:08:37.429
and our users and our marketing.
