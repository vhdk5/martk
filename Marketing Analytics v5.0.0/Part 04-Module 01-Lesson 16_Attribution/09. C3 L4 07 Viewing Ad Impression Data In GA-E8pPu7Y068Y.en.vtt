00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
We've seen a few cases where

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.400
ad impression data is available in the GA reporting interface,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.044
and you probably are wondering how that information got there.

00:00:09.044 --> 00:00:11.070
You can see Google AdWords,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.130
GDN or Google Display Network impression data in

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.190
your Multi-Channel Funnels and attribution reporting in GA.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.560
So, there are a couple of steps you need to

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.664
take to make sure that data comes through for you.

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:26.549
I just want to show you those settings briefly so that you can take advantage of having

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.600
that impression data in the reports that we've been looking at throughout this lesson.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.570
When you set up your AdWords link in Google Analytics,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.865
there will be an option at the bottom of the link that says

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:40.695
additional data and it'll say enable Google Display Network Impression reporting,

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:43.520
that checkbox must be selected.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.280
If you do not see this option in your account,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.450
you may need to reach out to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.495
your Google Ads rep and have them enable this feature for you.

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:52.879
When you see that checkbox, you can enable it,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.950
and it will bring in impression data for

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.560
your Google AdWords account for the display network.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.230
If you have a Google Tag Manager implementation,

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:01.879
you do not need to actually update

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.245
your Google Analytics tracking code and GTM will do this automatically.

00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:11.170
Under the advanced settings in the advertising drop-down in a Google Tag Manager,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.894
you just want to go ahead and click the checkbox for enable

00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:17.780
display advertising features as part of your Google Analytics Tag.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.390
Google Tag Manager will handle that for you if

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.820
you have the checkbox enabled that we just looked at,

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:27.649
and below is a reference to the Google support documentation for enabling this tracking.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.430
Two last simple requirements to know for the ad impression data,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.715
you must link your AdWords account at the account level

00:01:34.715 --> 00:01:38.480
rather than the MCC level in order for this functionality to be available.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.800
Also, please be sure to update your website privacy policy per

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.079
their requirements in the support documentation

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.219
to reflect the Google Display Impression Tracking
