00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
Let's revisit Multi-Channel Funnel reports or MCF.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.529
The MCF reports in Google Analytics start to take

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.425
us in the direction of multi-touch attribution.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:14.730
They don't get us all the way there like the attribution models comparison report will,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.289
but they start to let us see the way

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.304
our multi-channel marketing efforts overlap and support one another.

00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:23.905
They allow us to start looking at things like assisted conversions,

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:26.539
impression assisted conversions, and if we have

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.494
the data to support it, conversion padding.

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:32.810
They let us start playing with the look-back windows in our data

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.109
and so they can be very illuminating into our marketing programs.

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.539
Let's take a look in the Google Analytics interface

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.094
at those Multi-Channel Funnels reports.

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:43.850
To access Multi-Channel Funnels reports,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.789
I'm simply going to go to the conversions drop down,

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.280
look for Multi-Channel Funnels,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.509
and we'll start with the overview section.

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:55.219
Here, we can familiarize ourselves with

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.659
the basic configuration controls for the Multi-Channel Funnel reports.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.769
I could select conversion type and in this case,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.614
I recommend changing this conversion selection to include

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:13.669
only a single conversion type per analysis as I've done

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.900
here so that you make sure you're not doing things like comparing a purchase

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.109
completed with a conversion defined as something like a user registration.

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.000
While both actions may be important,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.250
you don't necessarily want to blend them in terms of

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.329
your analysis of what is driving those conversions.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.179
So, you really do want to look at them separately.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.185
In this case, I'm looking at e-commerce transactions.

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:42.710
You can also decide what type of interactions you would

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.324
like to include in your Multi-Channel Funnels reports.

00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:48.515
In this case, I want to see everything.

00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:51.340
I can also change the look-back window.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.790
So, if I have a product that is expensive and is a considered purchase,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.705
I might want to push this out to the limit of 90 days.

00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:02.599
It's going to attribute conversion activities to touch

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.839
points going back 90 days prior to the conversion event.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.219
This can be very helpful especially if I want to see the overlap between

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:14.824
different marketing channels and how they interact to drive conversions.

00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:17.889
I can see my last non-direct conversions,

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.349
I can also see click assisted conversions,

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.789
I can see impression assisted conversions,

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:28.329
and also rich media assisted conversions if I have them.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.825
For my display impressions where somebody saw an ad but didn't actually click through it,

00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:36.804
that could still obviously impact conversion activity on my website.

00:02:36.805 --> 00:02:43.780
I can also see the multi-channel overlap between channels visualized in the Venn diagram.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.650
It can be a handy reference for us to see how

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.314
important channels overlap and interact to drive conversions.

00:02:52.314 --> 00:02:54.280
In some cases, quite a lot,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.629
and in some cases,

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.359
not very much at all.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.080
To start seeing the power of the Multi-Channel Funnels,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.990
we start digging into the specific reports.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.409
In this case, let's look at assisted conversions for a moment.

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.409
The assisted conversions report is going to move us even

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.365
closer to the multi-touch attribution mindset,

00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:16.175
and it's going to start showing me my channel performance.

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:17.840
In this case, I like to use

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.250
the default channel grouping because that's what I use in other reports.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.360
The report is going to default to the Multi-Channel Funnel channel groupings which

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.820
will not include specific customizations you've made to your default channel grouping.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.844
So, just keep in mind that you'll want to use the appropriate

00:03:33.844 --> 00:03:37.625
channel grouping for your specific reporting purposes.

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:40.729
I can start to see how certain channels may or may

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:44.223
not drive a lot of value in terms of last click conversions,

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:47.899
but maybe driving a lot of value in terms of assisted conversions,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.349
and some channels have a certain balance of each.

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.789
But in this case,

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:57.620
nearly $665,000 in conversion value

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.120
was driven by assisted conversions from the referral channel,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.890
and only 409,000 from last click or direct conversion value for the referral channel.

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.194
So, most of the value of that channel is coming in the form of

00:04:14.194 --> 00:04:17.839
conversion assists and not inconsiderable amount of

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:21.544
conversions from the last click or direct conversions.

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:25.564
When we look at the standard acquisitions reporting,

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:31.115
some channels perform rather poorly in terms of conversion performance.

00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:34.475
So, if we get stuck in the last click mentality,

00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:38.510
we fail to see the full value of the channel

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.009
and what it's driving in terms of support for other channels.

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:48.500
Here, we can see that display is having a much more impact than it would appear just from

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.930
the last click or direct conversion value with $6,200 in assisted conversions.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.910
Paid search as well,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.515
almost $15,000 in assisted conversion value

00:05:00.514 --> 00:05:04.699
and just $3,800 in last click conversion value.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:10.295
In fact, because of the dependency on the GA cookie or user ID,

00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:15.620
there are in reality always more assists than GA can possibly report.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.225
We can also take it a step further into the top conversion paths report.

00:05:20.225 --> 00:05:22.010
This reporting allows us to see

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.634
the unique conversion paths for our website in a given time period.

00:05:25.634 --> 00:05:28.534
So, it allows us to see for example,

00:05:28.535 --> 00:05:35.260
I have 542 conversions worth $116,000 in conversion value,

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:41.800
where the channel path was a referral session followed by a direct session.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.069
In and of itself, that's probably not the most illuminating data we can see,

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.459
but if we filter to, for example,

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:51.589
conversion paths that include

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:58.129
display and we can see some more interesting conversion data.

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.639
Now, we can see we have users that

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.615
are taking very sophisticated journeys to get to the point of conversion.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.790
Here's somebody who was brought to the site

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.004
originally by a direct session followed by an organic search,

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:15.439
a display click, organic search,

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.125
two more direct sessions,

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:18.660
a paid search click,

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.095
an organic search click,

00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:28.720
followed by four more direct sessions to drive conversion value of $600 on the website.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.180
So, you can start to analyze and get insights into the way that

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.379
users really do interact with a variety of media,

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:41.219
in a variety of formats before they ever click the buy button.
