00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Let's talk about how Google Analytics reports direct traffic for a moment.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.919
Direct is an actual default channel grouping in Google Analytics,

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.250
but let's understand how it is really a channel of last resort.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.970
Only if no referring data is present on the inbound session and

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.370
no campaign data is associated with the user

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.800
that is within the campaign exploration window,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.755
only in that case will the traffic be countered as direct.

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:26.039
Let's take a look at a couple of examples to see how that actually

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.519
plays out from a data capture standpoint and reporting.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.230
In this first example,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.075
looking at one user's journey,

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:35.655
we're going to look at the time lag between sessions,

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:39.000
the source medium, the way a session will get attributed,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.215
and then whether or not it would be considered a direct session.

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:43.955
So, let's take a look here.

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:48.174
Session one comes in with the source medium Google CPC.

00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:51.759
It gets paid such as the attributed channel for that session,

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:54.695
and if you were to add the direct sessions dimension to a report,

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:56.570
you would see the value was no.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.134
Thirty days later, that same user comes back to the website through a bookmark link,

00:01:01.134 --> 00:01:03.909
with no source medium data present.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.354
This session again would get attributed to paid search.

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:09.695
It's within the campaign exploration window,

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:13.164
and you can see it, would get direct session flag as yes.

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:16.850
Sixty days the user comes back on that same bookmark link,

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:20.234
no source no medium value present for the session.

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:22.370
Again, the session would be attributed to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.675
paid search and the direct session flag would be yes.

00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:28.664
Ninety days later, the user comes back,

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:32.135
the sources facebook.com and the medium is referral.

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:36.035
This was from an untagged link on someone's personal Facebook post.

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:39.979
So, that session would actually be attributed to referral.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.829
In this case, we have new referral information

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.370
and it will overwrite the existing cookie value,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.189
and we will get an attribution to the Facebook referral source.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.649
Let's take a look at a second example with

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.415
a little bit longer time windows and slightly different user journey.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.365
Session one on day one,

00:01:57.364 --> 00:01:59.884
we have no source, no medium data.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:02.075
It gets captured in the direct channel,

00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:04.269
as a true direct session.

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:07.200
Thirty days later, they click on a paid search ad,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.905
so they come in with Google CPC.

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:12.560
The session gets credited with paid search,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.349
and the direct session flag would be no.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.609
Eight months later, they returned to the site directly,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.705
source medium is none.

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:24.860
Because it's outside the six-month campaign exploration window,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.030
again this is going to be a direct session.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.525
Ninety days later, the user comes in from a facebook.com referral.

00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:34.564
The medium is referral.

00:02:34.564 --> 00:02:38.150
In that case, it gets written as referral and Google Analytics.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.605
It is a referral session.

00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:41.514
It is not a direct session.

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:44.299
Thirty days later that person comes back to the site,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.430
directly from an untagged link,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.219
none for source, none for medium,

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.259
referral will get credit and direct session will be yes.

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.969
Hopefully, this gives you a better understanding of

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:00.349
how direct traffic is actually captured in Google Analytics and why.
