00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Let's talk about conversion segments briefly.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.600
Conversion segments allow you to compare how specific attributes of a conversion,

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:11.294
compared to one another as well as to your overall conversion characteristics.

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:14.160
This is useful to see how specific channels or

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.890
specific user journeys may differ between say,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.010
your overall customer base and your high value customers,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.429
or for journeys that started with a paid search session compared to those that

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.375
originated from display or rich media or some other source.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.824
It can be a useful way to start looking at differences in behavior

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:34.339
and attributes according to meaningful segmentation of your users.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.575
Let's jump into the interface and take a quick look

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:39.320
at how that actually applies in reports.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.070
Here in the multi-channel funnels reports for the top conversion paths,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.545
I've added a couple of conversion segments.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.990
You can see in the top navigation here I've added

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.940
the all conversion segments so that I have a meaningful basis of comparison.

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:57.559
I've also created this custom user-defined segment of conversion value

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.975
greater than 300 which is one and a half times my average conversion value.

00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:06.109
These would be my higher value conversions.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.614
I can see that conversion value over 300 is about,

00:01:10.614 --> 00:01:16.424
a little over 1,200 conversions or about $670,000 in revenue.

00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:18.649
So, these are not quite 20 percent of

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.340
my transactions and about half of my conversion revenue.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.370
This is a small slice of transactions that's making up a big percentage of value.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.920
So, I might want to know how these users behave differently on my site as well as

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.710
to mine for insights into differences in how I am acquiring these high-value converters,

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.664
to help me better identify target,

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:46.580
re-market, and message these users.
