00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
Google Analytics also allows you to profile users based on their behavior on your site.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.919
As we indicated before,

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.169
you can check how many of the sessions on

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.140
your website were from people who visited you before,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.890
returning visitors, or from people who are new to the site.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.660
Related to this, you can also learn how often your users come to your site.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.050
In this case, most users only come once.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.565
We see that because there is only a relatively small group of returning visitors.

00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:34.035
When reading these data, keep in mind that you're looking at a particular time frame.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.479
In this example, it's the month of August.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.509
But previous visits are counted for all time.

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:43.869
So, in this case, you can see that of the users that came to the site in August,

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:48.304
there are over 7,000 users that are visiting for the second time.

00:00:48.304 --> 00:00:51.320
These users visited the site before,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.475
but before may mean six months ago or it could mean earlier today.

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:59.495
If you'd like to get a sense of how long ago a previous visit of the user was,

00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:02.209
you can use the recency part of this report

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.525
by clicking on the Days Since Last Session link.

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:09.035
This report tells you how many sessions came from users

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:14.164
whose last visit to your site was one day ago or two days ago, et cetera.

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:15.560
Of course in this case,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.450
since we have so many new visitors,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.189
most sessions fall into the bucket of users who visited zero days ago.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.409
You can also take a look at your audience based on their engagement with the site.

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.939
When we talk about engagement,

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.299
we mean how engaged or interested the audience seems to be with the content.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.890
When using analytics tools,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.805
engagement will typically be expressed in terms of the amount of time

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:42.440
a user spends on the site or the number of page views the user's views.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.870
The time spent metric is best because

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.930
page views are often dependent on how the site is built.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.180
Say for example that the site has a blog with relatively lengthy posts,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.100
yet users visit the blog and read the posts.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.809
They would spend some time doing that,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.004
but there would only be one associated page view.

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:04.670
You'll also find that an increasing number of sites rely on users scrolling down on

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.349
a page to see a lot of information rather than clicking from page to page.

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.370
This is often considered a better user experience on a mobile device.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.980
Let's look at, Betabrand.com.

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:21.155
You can get a lot of information on cool new stuff they sell just by scrolling down.

00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:22.430
In a case like this,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.180
page views are not the best metric to evaluate user engagement.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.000
I suggest we focus on the time spent metric to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.254
categorize users into buckets of how they engaged.

00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:33.694
As we can see here,

00:02:33.694 --> 00:02:35.389
there is a large group of users on

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.964
the Google Merchandise Store who visit for less than 10 seconds.

00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:41.789
That's not really enough time to explore products,

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.294
let alone buy anything.

00:02:43.294 --> 00:02:46.819
That's too bad. Later, we should explore what's going on here.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.959
It looks like this group of users may not be satisfied with what they find on the site.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.129
So, it is worth isolating them as a segment to try to figure out that this group has

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.139
other different characteristics that may help us

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.229
understand why they're leaving after less than 10 seconds.
