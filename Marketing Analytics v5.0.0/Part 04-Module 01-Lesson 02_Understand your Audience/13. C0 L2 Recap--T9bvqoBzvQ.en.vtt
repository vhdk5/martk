00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.074
So, let's recap this lesson.

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:08.205
When you start evaluating how your site is doing and how your users interact with it,

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:11.820
studying your audience trend first is a good idea.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.699
You now know how many users come to your site

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.730
and how that user number is changing over time.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.420
You also know now how to look at reports to understand more about who your users are.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.030
You can evaluate their demographics,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.280
their interests, where they come from,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.884
what language they prefer,

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:35.140
their behavior and the technology they use to access your site.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.189
You also know how to assess how your users flow through your site.

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:44.420
So you have a good understanding now of who visits your site.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.120
Now let's learn how to evaluate where they're

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:50.134
coming from and how they found you in the first place.

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:52.929
We will cover that in the next lesson.
