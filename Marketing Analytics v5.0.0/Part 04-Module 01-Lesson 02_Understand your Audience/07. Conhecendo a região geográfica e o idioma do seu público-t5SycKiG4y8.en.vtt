One other popular way of looking at the audience that

00:00:02.758 --> 00:00:06.099
visits your website is through the geographic lens.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:10.015
Google Analytics shows you where your users are visiting from.

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:12.724
This could be at the country level as you can see here.

00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:14.083
And no surprise.

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:19.039
Most users of the Google online merchandise store are coming from the U.S.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.644
You can also look at the city level or the continent or sub-continents.

00:00:25.643 --> 00:00:30.409
You can also take a look at what language your users prefer to browse in.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.658
Understanding where your users come from and

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:36.170
what language they speak can be helpful for certain decisions.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.222
For instance, when Udacity evaluated which international markets to concentrate on,

00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:44.450
reports on where the users of our website came

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.000
from helped us decide where to launch our international offer first.
