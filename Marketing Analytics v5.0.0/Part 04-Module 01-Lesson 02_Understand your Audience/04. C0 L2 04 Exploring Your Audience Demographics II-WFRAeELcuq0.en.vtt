You may wonder how Google would have any information on the gender and age of the users,

00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:08.995
after all, they don't give us that information when they come to the site.

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:14.189
Google Analytics infers the demographic data based on the known user profile.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.669
For instance, if the user is logged in to other Google products,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.035
or based on the user's past browsing behavior that may reveal something about gender.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:25.605
For some users, Google cannot get this demographic data.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:29.175
As a result, you'll see a percentage at the top of each report

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:33.420
that indicates the percent of total users the data is based on.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.150
The yellow shield will also tell you the percentage of sessions the data is based on.
