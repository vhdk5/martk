00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
For anyone who owns a website,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.970
the number of people that come to visit that website is important.

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:10.605
In Google Analytics, the people that access your site are called users.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:13.350
They're visitors that had at least one session on

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.394
your website during the time period selected.

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:17.949
When you build a website,

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.710
you typically want as many users as possible.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.859
So, as a result,

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.050
the number of users is a good starting point to evaluate your site and its success.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.929
You will want to know how many users come and whether

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.729
your user number is increasing or decreasing.

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:37.129
We're back in the default audience overview.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.740
It looks like the Google Merchandise Store had over

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.145
61,000 users for the month I'm looking at.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.780
This is my audience.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.929
The people that found my site.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.159
Now, when you think of the customer journey,

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.009
this group of people is beyond the awareness point.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.379
They know about me but they've also shown me

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.200
that they're interested in coming to visit the site.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.480
The number of users I see here is for the time period I have selected.

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.179
But it's a good idea to evaluate user trends as well.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.210
You want to understand whether your user numbers are increasing,

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.194
or decreasing, or staying pretty much the same.

00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:13.859
Google adds a nice trend line here,

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.924
but the trend line is for sessions not users.

00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:18.545
There is a difference.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:21.980
A user can come back several times in a given time period,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.070
which could count as several sessions by one user.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.479
I'm interested now in just getting a sense of the number of people that came to my site.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.530
So, let's select this graph under the user number.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.460
Now, let's look at the trend for the last year.

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.669
That will give me an idea of how well I've been doing.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.835
So, I can change the settings here.

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:46.879
It looks like there was a user increase before the summer.

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:52.024
But I feel like we're back to where we started last year with how the numbers look now.

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:56.105
It's relatively hard to see if you look at the day by day trend.

00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:59.060
So, let's switch to a month by month view.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.060
It's the same data but the graph is different,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.640
since the data is aggregated by month.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.254
It looks like the user numbers decreased again.

00:02:08.254 --> 00:02:10.939
Let's take a look and see whether Google's left us

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.395
some notes on anything that happened that we should be aware of.

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:16.689
When you click on this pull down arrow,

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.699
you'll get the annotations that were left in the account.

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:23.629
In this case, Dee at Google put a few notes.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.305
It looks like a new website domain was adopted in July.

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:29.390
It's possible that could have something to do with

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.609
the decline we're seeing but hard to tell.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.220
Now, if you want to leave your own note you can

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.294
do that by clicking, create new annotation.

00:02:37.294 --> 00:02:40.714
Then you select the date and enter your note.

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:43.610
These notes can be very helpful if you want to remind

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.835
yourself or others of important things that happened on that day,

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.900
like a new campaign launch or a new AdWords campaign.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.170
On this overview page,

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:56.284
we can also immediately get a sense of the percentage of new versus returning visitors.

00:02:56.284 --> 00:03:00.229
In this case, it looks like the majority of the visitors are new.

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:05.644
This tells me that users that visit the store are not likely to come back within a year.

00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:10.564
It's not super surprising because you probably don't need a ton of Google swag.

00:03:10.564 --> 00:03:16.639
Note that Google Analytics uses visitors when referring to new and returning visitors.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.134
So, now we have a sense of how many users the site gets

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:23.479
and we know that the user numbers went down a bit after the summer.

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.554
We also know that most of the users are new to the site.

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:29.980
Let's take a look at who the new users are.
