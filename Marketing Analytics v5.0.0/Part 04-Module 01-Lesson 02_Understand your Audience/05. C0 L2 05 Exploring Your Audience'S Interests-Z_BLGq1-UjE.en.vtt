00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
So what can you do with this information?

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:07.559
You may learn new things about the audience that's attracted to your site and you can

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:09.884
evaluate some of that information against

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:12.990
the target persona you have in mind for the site.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.855
Is what you're finding aligned with the target?

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.080
It looks like the main affinity categories found among

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.919
users of the Google Merchandise Stores are technophiles,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.620
movie buffs, photography enthusiasts,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.740
news junkies, and mobile enthusiasts.

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.679
So then you want to ask yourself whether this

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.024
aligns with the type of person you are targeting with the store.

00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:38.929
Given that the merchandise store focuses on brand enthusiasts

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:42.679
for all of Google brands including Android and YouTube,

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.765
it seems pretty much like this is aligning with the user's Google would hope to attract.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:53.185
I can also use this information to learn something about who I may want to advertise to.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:55.370
For instance, I'm finding out that the people that

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:57.784
visit the merchandise store like movies.

00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:01.284
So maybe I can advertise on movie related sites.

00:01:01.284 --> 00:01:04.954
So here's where you find the interest data in Google Analytics.

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:08.510
Under the interests, you find different reports.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.730
Affinity categories; this gives you an overview of the affinities of your audience.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.975
What is it that your users seem interested based on their browsing behavior?

00:01:17.974 --> 00:01:22.384
These are relatively broad interest categories like technophiles.

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:25.410
These exact same categories are used in AdWords.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.670
So you can use this report to understand which categories of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.704
people are on your site and then use AdWords to advertise to them.

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:34.969
Then there's in market segments.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.855
These are groups of people that look like they're ready to buy a product.

00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:42.995
Here you will find categories related to different kinds of products.

00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:45.875
People who are ready to buy an airline ticket, for example.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:50.344
So these people are already a little further along in the customer journey.

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:53.030
Lastly, we have the other categories.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.254
These are even more granular interest categories

00:01:56.254 --> 00:01:59.030
like people who are into soccer for example.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.969
Note that none of these categories are exclusive.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.000
A user can belong to several categories at once.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.090
I may be a technophile and also be a movie lover.
