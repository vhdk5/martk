00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.710
The first statement is correct.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.129
We see indeed that of the users that land on the home page in the second interaction,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.445
32.1 percent of the sessions drop off.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.009
That's what the red line here indicates.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.500
Let's take a look at the second statement.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.730
This statement is about user sessions from users on Chrome.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.440
So let's isolate that group by looking at the flow by browser.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.525
Now, let's take a look at a Chrome users that visits the homepage.

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:31.379
We can do that by clicking on this part of

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:36.030
the user flow and when we follow this group to the next interaction,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.865
we see that 2.6K of the sessions end up on the T-shirt page not 2.3K.

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:44.539
So this statement is false.
