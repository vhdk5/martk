00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
Since you want to prioritize the bugs that affect most people,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.620
you would fix the bugs related to Chrome first in this scenario.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.750
Most of the sessions on the side are from

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.945
Chrome users as you can see in this browser report.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:17.335
In the second scenario, it seems wise to first fix the iOS issue,

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:19.969
since many more sessions are from iOS users,

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:24.554
then from users of the Google Nexus phone as this device report shows.

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:25.859
Of course in reality,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.475
there may be many more considerations that go into this prioritization.

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:33.630
For instance, how much effort will it take to fix each one of these bugs?

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.170
Nonetheless, understanding how many people are affected by these issues is very helpful.
