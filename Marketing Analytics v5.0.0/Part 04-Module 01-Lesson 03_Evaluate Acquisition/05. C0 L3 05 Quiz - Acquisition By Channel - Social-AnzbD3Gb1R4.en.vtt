00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
So here we're looking at a traffic coming into

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.759
the Google merchandise store through the social channel

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.039
for August 2016 and we do indeed see traffic coming in from Reddit.

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:12.884
In order to know what the traffic looks like,

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:15.855
we want to look at the source medium report first.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:20.699
Here on the second page, we see that the Reddit.com traffic is referral traffic.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.849
So, let's go take a look at the referrals

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.880
report to get a sense of what the traffic looks like.

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:28.579
It's the Reddit.com link.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:34.039
Here we find referring links that send traffic to the Google online merchandise store.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.929
Let's take a look at the main one.

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.479
It looks like a Reddit user was consulting

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.494
the network in a search for certain Google swag.

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:44.479
In doing so, he or she included a link to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.449
the Google merchandise store and that link is sending people over to the store.
