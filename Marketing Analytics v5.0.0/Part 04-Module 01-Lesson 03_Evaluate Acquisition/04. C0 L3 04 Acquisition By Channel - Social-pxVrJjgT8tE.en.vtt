00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
You will find that as a marketer,

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.209
starting to explore your data as a channel level is super helpful.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:07.980
By starting at this high level,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.830
you can get an initial understanding about which

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.129
channels seem to work well for you and you can then start to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.219
drill down by channel in order to get a good sense

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.744
of specific campaigns or content that worked for you.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:24.225
Let's take a look at what we can learn by doing just that.

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:27.030
The channels report gives me a high level view of

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.179
the channels that send traffic to the Google Merchandise Store,

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.625
sorted by default channel group.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.460
It looks like most of the traffic to the store for

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.224
this time period came from Social channels,

00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:41.000
closely followed by Organic Search.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.280
Let's take a look at these one by one,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.859
starting with the Social channel.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.435
Google Analytics classifies traffic from about 400 social networks in the Social channel.

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:53.480
The traffic could be from links and Facebook posts,

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.949
tweets or other less well-known social channels.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.929
You can see the main social networks sending traffic to

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.185
the merchandise store by clicking into the Social channel.

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:07.460
In this case, YouTube is clearly the main traffic driver.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:10.194
Note that YouTube is counted as a Social channel.

00:01:10.194 --> 00:01:15.309
But I'm curious, what would it be on the YouTube site that sends traffic over?

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.575
In order to find out,

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:19.415
I can first take a look at the Source/Medium report.

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:23.755
This report tells me that the medium is a referral from YouTube.

00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:27.859
So, let's check in the Referral report to get more details.

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.179
Here's YouTube.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.540
Let's click on it to get the exact referring page.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.060
It looks like traffic is coming to the merchandise store from the About pages.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.090
So let's go to that page.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.400
Indeed, there's a link to the merchandise store on the YouTube About page.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.880
Now that I know where the YouTube traffic is really coming from,

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:49.670
I might argue that this is not really social traffic.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.519
The nature of this link is a bit different from someone

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:55.670
posting something cool about my products on a social platform.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.640
So, that's why it's always good to drill down and

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.180
see what's really going on using detailed reports.
