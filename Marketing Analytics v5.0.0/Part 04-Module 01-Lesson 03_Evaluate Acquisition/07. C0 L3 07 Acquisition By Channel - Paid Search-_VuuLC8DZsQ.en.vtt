00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.299
As a marketer, you may choose to try and attract

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:06.080
people to your website with sponsored search ads.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.939
The page search traffic channel reports on

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:12.359
traffic that landed on your site by clicking on these ads.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.139
Here through the channels report,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.080
we get a high level view on the keyword that led people to click on your ads.

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.054
In the case of the Google Merchandise Store,

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:25.094
it looks like paid advertising was not the main traffic driver in August.

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:26.759
But there is some traffic.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.620
So, that tells me there were PPC search advertising campaigns running at the time.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.240
Let's take a look at the keywords associated with these ads,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.570
and which ones lead to visit on the sites.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.799
It looks like quite a bit of the paid search traffic came through dynamic search ads.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:46.054
In that case, we don't get to see the specific keywords.

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:49.820
Dynamic search ads are search ads for which you provide

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.914
the landing page you're targeting and Google scans the page automatically,

00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:56.269
and shows your ad when keywords show up that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.850
Google feels are related to the landing page.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.649
You don't specify the keyword.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.495
Instead, Google shows your ad when it believes the keyword is related to what you offer.

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:10.140
This is one of the options when you set up a search campaign in Google Ads.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.894
It looks like the other keywords are pretty generic and they refer to the store.

00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:15.409
So, as we mentioned before,

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.009
it might be interesting for the Google merchandise store team to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.835
consider buying a few more product specific keywords.

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:26.819
When you use the channels report to assess sponsored search traffic,

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.729
you get a high level view.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.670
You could however get a lot more detail by looking

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.924
into the Google Ads specific section here.

00:01:34.924 --> 00:01:40.204
Google Ads is the most commonly used platform for buying paid search advertising.

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.230
When you set up campaigns in Google Ads,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.875
you can link your Google Ads account to your Google Analytics account.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.260
When you do that, Google Analytics will report on

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.930
the traffic from paid search by campaign,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.055
and we'll add cost information and other data related to your campaigns.

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:57.590
The big benefit of linking Google Ads

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.200
to Google Analytics is that it will give you a chance to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.390
take a deeper look at how the traffic that

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.450
comes from the different campaigns behaves on your site.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.824
So, you get more information than just click-throughs.

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:13.494
It will help you evaluate which campaigns bring you the most valuable traffic.

00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:16.310
We'll see more about how to evaluate that later.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.250
You can find more information on how to link your Adwords

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.150
