00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Referral is another important channel.

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.699
In Google Analytics, it captures the traffic that comes

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.089
to the site by clicking on a link in another website.

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:11.503
As a website owner or marketer,

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:14.250
you may know of some of the links that are out there,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.129
because they may be a result of a deal where

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:20.699
you asked another website owner to set up a link for you,

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.869
or you may have asked a blogger to write about you and insert a link.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.490
There may also be PR related stories that carry a link to your site.

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.409
But there are often links out there that you don't know about.

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:38.709
Someone may have included your website in a story or as a helpful link on their website.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.399
In this referral report,

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.329
you can take a closer look at the traffic that comes in through all of these links.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.394
It gives you a sense of the links that exist. Let's take a look.

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:52.955
The detail in the Referral Report shows you the links you're getting the traffic from.

00:00:52.954 --> 00:00:57.484
In this case, you can see that other Google domains are sending traffic to the store.

00:00:57.484 --> 00:00:59.420
That's not really a surprise.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.635
You can also see this Google Analytics Domain here as a referral.

00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:07.129
That's because of students like you who click on the embedded links in

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:11.479
this Google Analytics account to see the underlying web pages in the store.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.829
This is an interesting external domain, siliconvalley.about.com.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.890
Let's check out what that is.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.900
It looks like there are two pages in

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.555
this domain that have a link to the merchandise store.

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:25.370
Let's click on the first one here,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.290
and look at what this really is.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.200
Looks like it's some advice on touring the Googleplex,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.564
the Google Campus, and a reference on souvenirs you can pick up while you are there.

00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:39.500
Two hundred and sixty four sessions resulted from the links this website put up.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.680
This gives you a glimpse at the power of referrals.
