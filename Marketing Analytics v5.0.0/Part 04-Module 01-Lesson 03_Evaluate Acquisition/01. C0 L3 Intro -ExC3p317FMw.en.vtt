00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
In the previous lesson,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.500
you learned how to assess the size of your audience in Google Analytics,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.695
and we learned more about who they are.

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:11.970
In this lesson, you will learn how to assess where your visitors

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.649
came from in the first place or through which marketing channels you acquired them.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.969
Remember how every potential customer for your product is on

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:26.654
a journey and you want that journey to result in a purchase or an action on your site.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:29.175
You use different marketing tactics to

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:32.340
influence people in different stages of their journey,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.080
to try to make this happen.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.449
For instance, you use advertising,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.565
promotions content et cetera to attract attention and persuade your potential customer.

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:47.375
As a marketer you will make use of different channels to get your message out.

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:51.539
Examples of marketing channels are: display advertising,

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.865
search advertising, search engine optimization,

00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:57.535
social network content et cetera.

00:00:57.534 --> 00:01:00.009
Now when people show up on your site,

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.219
it's helpful to know which digital channels sent them over,

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.090
so you understand better,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.960
which one of your marketing channels seems to work best.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:12.714
So you want to know how people ended up on finding you,

00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:14.850
what convinced them to come.

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:20.019
Looking into acquisition reports in Google Analytics helps us to find out.
