00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.530
There are a few more channels we did not look at yet.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.820
I'm lumping them all together here because they all relate to marketing activity.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.560
And in order to get good detail on what is going on with these channels,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.929
you need to make sure to implement UTM codes for

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.070
the learning pages that are associated with these marketing activities.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.260
Display advertising, these are the display ads that link to your site.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.030
For instance, a banner ad that showcases the merchandise you sell,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.220
like this one from beta brands.

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.310
If I'm a marketer for beta brands I should make sure to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.480
add UTM codes when setting up an ad like this.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:41.359
Such that when I see traffic through to display acquisition channel,

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.134
I can tell which campaign it is coming from.

00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:47.824
The UTM code allows me to add a campaign name

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:51.844
and other info that helps me identify the link in this report.

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:54.740
E-mail, this is the traffic that's coming in through

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.664
e-mails you may have sent such as newsletters,

00:00:57.664 --> 00:00:59.600
promotional offers, et cetera.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.005
You see an example here of a newsletter from Udacity.

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.525
Again, when setting up these e-mails,

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:08.420
you should make sure to include UTM codes that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.100
help you to trace back where the traffic came from.

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:15.439
Affiliates, this is traffic coming from

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.935
affiliate marketing deals you may have in place with partners.

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:22.670
Such deals typically mean that you agree to pay a partner for

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.019
a referral that comes in through the link that they placed on their site.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.299
If you have such deals in place,

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.744
you can track here how well they are working.

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:34.100
A good example of sites that uses

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:37.924
affiliate marketing to get people to come to the side is Amazon.

00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:39.859
If you have a blog for instance,

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.680
in which you refer to Amazon's products with a link directly to the Amazon product page,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.575
you get paid a small referral fee by Amazon for sending them traffic.

00:01:50.575 --> 00:01:55.159
So here's the overview for the Google merchandise store acquisition channels.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.219
You can see the channels I just discussed here.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.840
As you can see in the report,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.240
both affiliate deals and display send

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:05.420
a decent amount of traffic to the Google merchandise store.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.050
There's very little traffic coming from e-mail links.
