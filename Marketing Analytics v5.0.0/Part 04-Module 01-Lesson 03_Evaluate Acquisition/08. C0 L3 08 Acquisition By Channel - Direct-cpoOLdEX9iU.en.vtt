00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.730
The direct traffic channel refers to traffic that came

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.000
to your site without clicking on a link in another domain.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.469
Instead, it's the traffic that came by typing in the URL of your site,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.225
in the URL bar or by clicking on a previously saved bookmark.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.850
Monitoring direct traffic to your site can

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.520
give you an indication of the strength of your brand.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.024
For instance, if I'm beta brand a lot of my traffic may come to me through my email and

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:31.754
advertising campaigns but over time

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:34.799
as people get to know the brand and what it stands for,

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:37.649
they may come to decide without these triggers.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.820
If the number of people accessing your site directly increases,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.575
it may tell you that more people know and remember your brand's.

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:48.740
However, it has become less straightforward to come to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.765
that conclusion as fewer and fewer people typing URLs in the browser bar.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:58.159
We've become accustomed to the search engines being super good at providing

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.134
us the results fast and as a result people will often

00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:05.450
type the brand name of a sites they want to navigate to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.790
inner search engine rather than spell out

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.635
a full URL in the browser bar even if they know the URL.

00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:16.145
Nonetheless, let's take a look at what we find in the direct traffic report.

00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:19.459
The detail behind that direct traffic report provides you with

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.819
the landing pages where that traffic enters the site.

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:25.389
When looking at this report for the Google merchandise store,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.540
you may be a bit surprised seeing URLs like the ones here.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.795
I'm surprised anyone recall that URL by heart.

00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:36.745
It also seems strange to assume that a lot of people would bookmark this.

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:40.700
This actually points to one of the common issues with the direct traffic report.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.640
Google Analytics will categorize traffic as direct when it does

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.209
not see a referring domain in the data it records.

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.594
This happens when there's no domain to record

00:01:49.594 --> 00:01:52.474
like in the case when you type in the URL directly.

00:01:52.474 --> 00:01:55.640
But it can also happen when traffic comes in by clicking on

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.329
a link in a document outside the typical browser environment.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.715
So that could be in an email for instance,

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:03.905
in Outlook or in a PDF document.

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:07.340
In a case like that no referring domain is passed on to Google.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.805
So, Google would bucket this traffic into the direct channel.

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:14.180
If these links relate to an email marketing campaign for instance,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.040
you can avoid this from happening by using UTM codes as we discussed before.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:22.009
That way you can pass information to Google to let

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.144
Google know that this link is associated with a campaign.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.750
If you forget to do this,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.439
the traffic may be labeled direct traffic and that makes it harder for

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.490
you as a marketer to get a good understanding of the success of your campaigns.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.400
So, now that it looks like the direct traffic report for

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.980
the merchandise store includes some traffic that does not seem to really be direct,

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.625
how can you use this report?

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:47.090
Well, if you really want to understand how many people come to the store directly,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.530
you can do so by isolating the direct traffic that lands on the homepage.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.830
You can click on the homepage link as you see in the image.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.170
While this could still include some other traffic,

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:01.179
it will give you the best approximation of the real direct traffic that

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.200
people who remember your name and brand and use the URL to get to your site.
