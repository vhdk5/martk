00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Let's move onto the organic search channel.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.128
This is the traffic coming to your site by

00:00:05.128 --> 00:00:08.024
clicking on a link in search engine results pages.

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:10.710
An organic link not a page ad,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.525
because of Google's dominance in the search space.

00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:16.155
Most of the traffic comes from the Google search engine,

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.795
but other search engines are also included here.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.495
For instance Yahoo, Bing, et cetera.

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:24.025
Here we are back in the channel's report.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.570
When looking into the organic search channel,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.469
we can find the report on the main keywords that users are searching

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:36.353
for that ultimately let them to click on a link to the store.

00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:39.853
Note that a main keyword line says not provided.

00:00:39.853 --> 00:00:42.774
When users search using the Google search engine,

00:00:42.774 --> 00:00:47.173
Google will protect users' privacy when they're logged in to other Google services.

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:49.732
Like for instance Google mail or chrome.

00:00:49.732 --> 00:00:50.968
For a logged in user,

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.039
Google does not pass information about a keyword to users

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.590
who are searching for unto the Google Analytics report.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.729
So we are a bit in the dark about the keywords

00:00:59.728 --> 00:01:02.969
that lead to clicks on organic search results.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.819
Unfortunately, the majority of users are logged in.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:11.954
The key words that are reported from not logged in users or from other search engines,

00:01:11.953 --> 00:01:14.625
still reveal some interesting information.

00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:18.468
In this case, it looks like the keywords are all pretty generic.

00:01:18.468 --> 00:01:19.640
That's quite surprising.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.754
I would have expected to see more product related terms

00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:26.385
like Google t-shirt for instance or Google mugs.

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:27.734
Something may be going on,

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:31.125
on the search results pages that makes people not click.

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:33.733
Let's try and take a look ourselves.

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:38.143
This is the search engine results page for a search for Google T-shirt.

00:01:38.144 --> 00:01:39.519
There are many links here to

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:43.765
the Google merchandise store so it looks like that is not an issue.

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:48.250
However there are also many image rich placements here.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.420
The top ones are sponsored ads and these images

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.379
may distract users from clicking on the organic links.

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:58.109
If I were managing the Google all my merchandise store,

00:01:58.108 --> 00:02:01.108
I would evaluate whether I should buy this keyword and

00:02:01.108 --> 00:02:04.227
try to get my own sponsored ads to appear here as well,

00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:08.003
since this search engine results page is pretty competitive.

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:12.079
It is worth digging into the acquisition channels one by one this way.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.175
Even when your user base is growing,

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:16.680
understanding the acquisition channels a bit better

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.593
can reveal interesting opportunities for further growth.

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:21.590
Since we're talking about search,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.150
let's take a look at a paid search traffic next.
