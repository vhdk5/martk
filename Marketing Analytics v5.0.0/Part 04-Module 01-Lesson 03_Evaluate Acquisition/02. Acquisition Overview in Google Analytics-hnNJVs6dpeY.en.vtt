00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.910
As we saw in the first lesson on Google Analytics,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.698
in order to see data in Google Analytics you need to

00:00:08.698 --> 00:00:13.189
insert the code Google provides on every page of your web site.

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.314
This code will collect the data.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.698
For every page accessed by a user,

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.801
the referring link is part of the data collected by this code.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.018
The referring link is the url of the web page that

00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:29.229
has the link to use it clicked on to get to your site.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.134
Now, that works if the link is part of content on a site.

00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:37.140
For instance, if I write a blog post and I link to a piece of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.118
clothing you can find on Betabrand you will see my blog is the referring url.

00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:44.905
That's an organic referral.

00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:46.140
No one paid for it.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.215
The link was established organically.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:53.795
It works a bit different for ads and marketing campaigns.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:58.515
The information that's automatically picked up by analytics tools like Googles

00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:03.740
is not very informative and will often show the ad platform as a referrer.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.870
Let's look at this ad for Betabrand, for example.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.849
If a user clicks on the ad,

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:11.459
it does not really help me to know that the ad was

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:15.109
served using Google advertising network for instance.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:19.393
As a marketer, I really want to know which ads the user clicked on,

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:21.920
and which campaign this was part of.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.325
That's what I want to see in the data.

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:30.525
Fortunately, there is a way for you as a marketer to help the reporting tools a bit.

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:35.849
You do that by tagging every ad or campaign with information

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:41.552
that tells the analytics tool how to classify your ad as the referrer.

00:01:41.552 --> 00:01:44.079
The way this works is as follows.

00:01:44.078 --> 00:01:48.583
When you create the ad or campaign you should add a small piece of

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:53.894
extra text to the landing page url in the tool where you create the ad.

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:57.615
That piece of text is called a UTM code,

00:01:57.614 --> 00:02:01.199
and it helps Google Analytics to classify the traffic

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.435
coming to your Web site via campaigns in the appropriate bucket.

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:11.039
For instance, traffic from display ads or traffic from search,

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:12.688
pay per click ads,

00:02:12.688 --> 00:02:16.644
traffic from social ads, et cetera.

00:02:16.645 --> 00:02:19.139
Now, when a user clicks on the ads,

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.625
like here in the Betabrand example,

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:25.335
the landing page url shows the UTM code

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:29.534
or the piece of text that you added in setting up the campaign.

00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:32.549
And that piece of text helps Google Analytics

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.775
classify the traffic as coming from a display ad.

00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:40.063
If you want to learn more about how to create these links,

00:02:40.063 --> 00:02:43.799
you can find the information in the notes below.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.155
If you want to get a good understanding of which marketing campaigns are working for you,

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:54.270
it's really important to add these UTM codes for all campaigns.
