00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
So now we have a better idea of how to evaluate

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.359
to different traffic acquisition channels for a site.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.875
Next, we'll take a closer look at how that traffic behaves on the site,

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:12.390
how do people navigate,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.625
which pages get attention etc.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.175
This is super important as a next step.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.010
Attracting traffic alone is not enough if that

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.325
traffic does not do anything meaningful on your site,

00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:27.839
or if they do not help you to achieve the goals that matter to your business,

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.614
your traffic acquisition efforts fall flat.

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:35.829
So let's learn how to evaluate the behavior on the site in our next lesson.
