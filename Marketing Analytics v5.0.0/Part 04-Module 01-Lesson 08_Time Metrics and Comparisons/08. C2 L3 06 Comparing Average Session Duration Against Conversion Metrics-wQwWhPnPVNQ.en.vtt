00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
Let's now consider this question,

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:05.924
is an increase in time metrics a positive indicator?

00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:08.504
The answer is, it depends.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:12.255
First, we'll want to consider different business models.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:13.650
If you are offering

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.885
primarily a publishing model and user engagement in itself is a good thing,

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:22.140
then an increase in time metrics would be a good thing.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.300
If your model is lead generation,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.445
an increase in time would be good if you also saw an increase in lead submissions.

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:34.380
Similarly, if your model is e-commerce and increase in time metrics would

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.410
be positive if we also saw an increase in conversion rate and revenue.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.194
In the merchandise store account,

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:46.289
I've gone back to January 1st to December 31st of 2016

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.884
for a good illustration of time metrics versus conversion metrics.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:55.554
First, I'm going to smooth out the time interval two month instead of day.

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:59.149
Next, I'm going to change the metric charted in

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.799
the main overtime graph from users to average session duration.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.230
Now we see considerable fluctuation in

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.960
average session duration over the course of the year.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:12.019
How can we know if this was a good thing or a bad thing?

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:17.119
Let's chart a second metric on the main overtime graph, e-commerce conversion rate.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.655
Now we're telling a more meaningful story.

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:21.920
We see towards the end of the year,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.055
when average session duration went up the most sharply,

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:30.095
we also saw a sharp increase in e-commerce conversion rate just what we'd want to see.

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:32.150
On the other hand, we may notice that in

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.844
July average session duration also went up considerably,

00:01:35.844 --> 00:01:38.825
but e-commerce conversion rate went down for the month.

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:42.844
We'll get the scoop on this when we talk about annotations in an upcoming lesson.

00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:47.090
But for now, we want to remember that for a transactional experience,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.210
average session duration needs to be clarified with a conversion metric.
