00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
We remember from the previous course that there are

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.889
many types of user behaviors that are not tracked as

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:08.294
pageviews and that we have to track

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:11.925
as events as part of our implementation customization.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:14.714
Just as pageview hits include a time stamp,

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.370
event hits also include a time stamp.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.804
So, GA does have the same field to work with

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:24.719
in pageview hits and event hits for time calculations.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:28.875
Let's consider an example of a time metric calculation with events.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:32.475
Again, this is going to get a little bit complicated,

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.995
but the take-aways will be clear.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:38.039
Let's say the user lands on page A.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:44.844
After five minutes, that user views page B and we have time on page A five minutes,

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.030
session duration five minutes.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.160
But let's say on page B,

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.429
after two minutes, the user starts a video.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.240
At that point, we still don't have a time on page metric for

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.240
page B because we have not sent another pageview hit.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.115
We've sent an event hit.

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:07.385
Calculation for session duration is based both on event and pageview hits,

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:11.810
but time on page takes only pageview hits into consideration.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.825
After 16 minutes, a video 25 percent viewed event is sent to GA.

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:21.620
Session duration is now up to 23 minutes.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.995
After another 16 minutes,

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:27.814
video 50 percent event viewed is sent to GA.

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:31.640
Session duration is now up to 39 minutes.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.450
Let's say after another two minutes the user navigates to page

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.650
C. The session has been maintained because we have not

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.410
gone more than a half an hour without sending a hit to

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.390
GA. GA consider sessions based not only on pageview hits,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.594
but on any hit that we send to it, including event hits.

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:54.125
At this point, GA will calculate

00:01:54.125 --> 00:02:00.950
a 41 minutes session duration and page B will get a time on page of 36 minutes.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.215
Once we go to page D,

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:06.480
we get a time on page for page C of

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.670
three minutes and session duration goes up to 44 minutes.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:15.589
Average session duration is calculated much more accurately when we're sending events to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.175
GA. Time on page is also calculated more accurately in that with events,

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:24.200
we can maintain better session continuity.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:29.584
We also remember from a previous course that event tracking helps GA calculate

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:32.240
a more accurate bounce rate because if

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.695
a user lands on a landing page and then generates an event,

00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:40.340
that session is not a bounce session because two hits had been sent to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.140
GA indicating that the user was engaged enough to take an additional action.
