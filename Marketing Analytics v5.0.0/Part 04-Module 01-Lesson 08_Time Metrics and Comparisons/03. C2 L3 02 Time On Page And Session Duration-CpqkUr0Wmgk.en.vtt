00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
In this section, we'll discuss average time on page

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.439
and average session duration metrics in Google Analytics.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.589
We'll want to keep in mind the concept of scope.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.960
Average time on page is

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.450
a hit scope metric relating specifically to page views and average session duration

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.519
is a session scope metric.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.449
This will determine which reports these two metrics appear in.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.789
We're back in the merchandise store account in the all pages report of the Main View.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.325
Note that the average time on page metric appears in this report,

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:37.925
average time on page related to page hits.

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:41.839
However, if we navigate to the landing pages report,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.990
notice that average session duration appears.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.395
We can report on average session duration for

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:52.720
each landing page because each landing page begins with a session.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.350
Therefore, we can report session scope metrics for landing pages.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.965
If we navigate to audience overview,

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:06.745
we also see average session duration here for all sessions within the view.

00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:11.585
If we navigate to other reports such as the channels report,

00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:15.319
we see average session duration reported here and if

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.769
we navigated to one of the technology reports,

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:20.724
lets say browser and OS,

00:01:20.724 --> 00:01:26.849
we would also see average session duration here reported as a session scope metric.
