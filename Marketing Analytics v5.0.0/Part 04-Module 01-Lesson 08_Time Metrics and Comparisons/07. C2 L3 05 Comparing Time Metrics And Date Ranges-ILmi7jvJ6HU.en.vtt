00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
We saw in the previous sections that the calculations of time metrics in GA can

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.245
be a little complicated and may not always reflect user engagement accurately.

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:15.195
We always want to remember to use the time metrics comparatively in GA.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:18.629
In this section, we're going to compare average time

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.004
on page for pages that are supposed to have similar purpose.

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:26.774
We'll also compare average session duration for a number of sessions scope dimensions.

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:32.625
Then we'll switch gears and we'll compare different metrics across two date ranges.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:34.530
On the Google merchandise store,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.884
there are many different types of product pages.

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:40.604
If we navigate to apparel, kid's,

00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:45.424
we see that there are several onesies available for the very little people in our lives.

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:48.964
In the all pages report of the merchandise store demo account,

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:52.130
if we filter for onesie and switch to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.875
the comparison display and select average time on page as our comparison metric,

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:00.079
we can see how the different onesie pages are

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.140
performing in terms of average time on page.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.969
I'm actually going to go ahead and modify

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:07.609
the filter and clean this report up a little bit more.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:13.819
I'm going to exclude page containing.axd.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:17.479
The general take-away that I get from this is that folks might be more

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.150
interested in dressing their babies up in colors than in just white or gray.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.910
If we navigate to the landing pages report,

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.629
we can see how our different shop by brand pages are performing,

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:31.969
in terms of average session duration.

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.039
Again, in this case,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.050
the landing page would be beginning

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.334
the session that the average session duration applies to.

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:43.354
Shop by brand and we'll escape

00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:48.800
the plus signs as we learned about in our regular expression discussion.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.364
Let's also switch over to comparison,

00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:54.724
change a comparison metric to average session duration.

00:01:54.724 --> 00:01:56.929
We can see that there are many more sessions

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.965
starting than the Google or Android shop by brand pages.

00:02:00.965 --> 00:02:04.909
But we do see that the average session duration is a lot lower for

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.750
YouTube than for Google or Android shop by brand pages.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.115
So there could potentially be the beginning of an optimization opportunity there.

00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:16.290
If we navigate to source medium,

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.474
we can also see a broad range of values for average session duration.

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.590
Average session duration, therefore,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.620
can be one of the metrics that we're using to

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.284
evaluate the quality of the sessions that originate from the different source mediums.

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:36.819
We're now going to switch gears and talk about a different type of time comparison,

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.789
actually selecting two different time periods in the GA UI.

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:46.094
So far, we've had January 1st to March 31st, 2018 selected.

00:02:46.094 --> 00:02:50.750
For this example, I'm going to start by selecting April 2018.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.430
If we want to select the whole month,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.784
we just have to click April 2018. Click apply.

00:02:56.784 --> 00:02:58.859
Comparing to the same time period

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.265
the previous year can be a very valid approach to take as part of our analysis.

00:03:04.264 --> 00:03:07.339
If we click the time selection drop-down,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.229
and we click compare to,

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.004
we may be tempted to select previous year.

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:13.639
Let's go ahead and do that.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.250
But we notice an issue.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.294
There is a one-day offset in the time periods.

00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:21.409
The days of week are not aligned.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.090
Whenever it's possible, we want to try to align days of

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.110
the week in the time periods that we're comparing.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.160
Ideally, we don't want to compare five Sundays to four Sundays.

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.599
So let's adjust our time selection. Click the drop-down.

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:41.489
We'll change the compare-to period to April 2nd through May 1st of the previous year.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.314
Click apply. Now, with the date offset by one day,

00:03:46.314 --> 00:03:49.865
we can see that the days of the week are perfectly aligned.

00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:51.740
With the time comparison applied,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.765
there's a lot of data in the report.

00:03:53.764 --> 00:03:57.724
So let's filter the report down to a single source medium.

00:03:57.724 --> 00:04:00.349
Since we're paying for Google CPC traffic,

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.509
let's see how that is performing,

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:07.699
this April versus the most closely corresponding time period in the previous year.

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.424
Basic table filter.

00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:11.705
If we look at the performance metrics,

00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:17.165
we see that bounce rate is actually up significantly, April 2018.

00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:22.285
Session duration is down and e-commerce conversion rate is down.

00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:24.870
With the two different time periods selected,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.730
we can compare time metrics,

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.819
but we can compare other metrics as well.
