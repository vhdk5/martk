00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.334
In this section, we'll continue to talk about conversions.

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:05.835
But in this case,

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:09.509
we'll look at goals that are themselves based on time.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.289
In the previous courses,

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:13.514
we looked at goal configuration.

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:17.865
The types of goals we've considered so far had been action goals,

00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:21.089
goals based on a specific user interaction.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.254
Action goals can be either destination goals,

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:26.504
when a user reaches a certain page,

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:29.204
or a goal based on an event.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:33.164
You could configure action goals for lead submission,

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:36.774
newsletter sign-up, or video completion.

00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:41.704
The two other types of goals that you can configure are sometimes referred to as

00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:46.609
engagement goals because they're not about a specific user interaction,

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.200
instead, they represent a threshold of engagement.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.420
These engagement goals are most often suitable for publisher models.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.760
Engagement goals can be based on either session duration or pages per session.

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:05.105
Back in the test view of the org test account.

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:06.960
If we click on Goals,

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:10.909
New Goal, we can configure a duration based goal.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.954
We'll call this goal session greater than five minutes.

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:19.995
Select Duration as the type, continue,

00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:23.585
Duration greater than five minutes.

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:25.265
With this goal configured,

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:28.974
we could use it to evaluate any of our session scope dimensions.

00:01:28.974 --> 00:01:31.799
For instance, in the channels report,

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.349
we can see how the different channels are performing in terms of session duration,

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:40.849
and specifically meeting the session greater than five-minute goal.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:44.944
Again, we want to keep in mind that a goal based on session duration

00:01:44.944 --> 00:01:49.324
or pages per session would be more suitable for a publisher model,

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:53.284
than any transactional or e-commerce model.

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:57.709
We also want to remember not to take the goal completely literally,

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.989
because GA may not always be able to calculate the exact session duration.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.420
But the session duration and goal

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.319
calculation are handled the same for all of our channels.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.810
Therefore, we can use this goal as a co-operative metric to evaluate channel performance.
