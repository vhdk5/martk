00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
How does Google Analytics calculate average time on page,

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.400
and average session duration?

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.505
The explanation can get a little bit detailed.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:13.050
The moral of the story is going to be use time metrics comparatively.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.045
So, don't be overly concerned about the actual time metric calculations.

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:22.959
We'll recall from previous sections that when a pageview is sent to Google Analytics,

00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.429
it contains many fields including the timestamp.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.179
The HIT timestamp is the basis of the time metrics calculation in

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.814
GA. Time metrics calculation can be a little bit surprising at first.

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:36.629
Let's walk through an example.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.415
Let's say that someone lands on page A on your website at 10 o'clock,

00:00:41.414 --> 00:00:44.825
GA actually does not start calculating time

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:48.365
until another pageview is sent with another timestamp.

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:53.765
GA time metrics are based on the differential between timestamps of Hits.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.689
Now that we have sent another pageview HIT into GA,

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.419
the time on page A is five minutes,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.240
and session duration is now five minutes.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.865
These calculations don't happen in real-time.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.549
This of course, happens during the processing.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.034
Now, page B doesn't have a time on page,

00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:17.479
and the session duration doesn't increase until we access page C. At that point,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.240
time on page for page B is two minutes,

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:22.493
and session duration has incremented,

00:01:22.493 --> 00:01:25.230
page D will send another timestamp.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.924
So, now we have time on page for page C,

00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:31.369
session duration is incremented.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.210
But what happens when the user gets that 31 minute phone call and the session expires?

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:43.369
In this case, if page E is sent to Google Analytics 31 minutes after page D,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.454
a new session begins.

00:01:45.454 --> 00:01:48.769
Page D does not get any time on page,

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:50.629
because it's considered the exit page,

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:52.045
or the previous session.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:55.010
Now, the clock has started ticking on a new session.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.365
When page F is sent to GA,

00:01:57.364 --> 00:02:00.589
we have time on page of six minutes for page E,

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.674
and session duration of six minutes for the second session,

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:07.149
and the process continues.
