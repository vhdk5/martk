00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.094
This section is all about time in Google Analytics.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:06.279
We'll discuss how the time metrics are

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.445
calculated including time on page and average session duration.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:16.265
We'll also talk about how page views and events affect the time metrics.

00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:21.885
We'll emphasize that we should use time metrics comparatively rather than literally.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:25.845
We'll consider if increase time is a positive indicator,

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:29.329
and we'll also take a look at time-based goals.
