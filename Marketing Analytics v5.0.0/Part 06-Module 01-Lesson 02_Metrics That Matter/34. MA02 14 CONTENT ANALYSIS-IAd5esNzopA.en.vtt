00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
Content marketing is at the core of many online marketing campaigns,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.110
and you'll find yourself tasked with reporting on

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.095
a wide variety of metrics surrounding your content.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:12.600
Now when it comes to our content analysis,

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.464
we're often looking at three areas.

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:19.670
The first is the performance of our own published content.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.280
Things like e-books, blog articles podcasts, videos and presentations.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.075
Second is the performance of our competitor's content.

00:00:29.074 --> 00:00:32.269
We want to evaluate all of the types of content that they're

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.530
building and understand how it's performing and finally,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.725
the content generated by others about us.

00:00:39.725 --> 00:00:43.445
This could be social media mentions or blog articles.

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:47.600
Now we look at all of this data a variety of different ways.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.515
For our content, we're trying to understand what's the goal,

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.244
why did we build this content.

00:00:53.244 --> 00:00:55.179
Now when we started making the content,

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.369
we should've been establishing what we want to be measuring.

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:00.949
So we will measure that information basically

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.655
in the same manner that we measure our owned media.

00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:08.299
In this case, we're usually interested in many of the same metrics as our website.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.439
How many people are engaging with this content?

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.469
How much time are they spending with it?

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.560
Is this leading to them consuming more content from us?

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.564
We also want to understand how this content is impacting the journey on the funnel.

00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:23.974
If someone is downloading a piece of content and not doing anything after that download,

00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:27.349
well, we'd want to look at those metrics and understand why.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:29.274
For our competitive content,

00:01:29.275 --> 00:01:32.855
we typically want to answer a variety of questions such as,

00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:35.255
how often is this content being published?

00:01:35.254 --> 00:01:37.594
Who is the target for this content?

00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:39.969
Is this content high-quality?

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.355
Who else might be linking to this content?

00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:45.469
For that, we're trying to get a gauge of how much this content is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.769
being shared by other prominent sources around the web.

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:53.250
We're also interested in what keywords this brand is targeting by that content,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.359
perhaps we're competing on the same keywords or we're

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.185
identifying the white-space for where we want to go where they aren't.

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:02.960
We also want to understand what the purpose of this content is.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.994
We have to think strategically to understand where in that customer journey

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:11.870
this brand has positioned that content and what they're hoping that content delivers.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.710
We also want to take a step at understanding how many people are

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.560
engaging with this content and that it's important to

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.264
understand if there are any influencers or prominent journalists

00:02:21.264 --> 00:02:26.710
associated with this content and when it comes to content generated about us,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.820
well we're interested in many of the same questions but also we're really going to be

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.334
curious about who is writing about us and where's that content showing up.

00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:38.875
Now there are a couple of tools that help answer these questions.

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:42.055
One of my personal favorites is BuzzSumo.

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:47.455
It allows you to analyze what content performs best for any topic or competitor.

00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:51.355
You can also discover engaging content and outreach opportunities.

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:54.250
Not only can you identify topics to write about,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.319
but you can also see what's already been published on

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.435
a particular topic or all of the content published by a particular competitor.

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:05.659
This helps you find venues for your content or to

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.349
identify influencers who might be able to amplify your message.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.810
Another resource is Cision.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.314
This is primarily a database of influencers,

00:03:14.314 --> 00:03:17.780
so they'll use it to find the right people to connect with and then

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.199
you can have them distribute your content or your press releases

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.579
and they also feature monitoring tools that measure your channel reach and the type

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.485
of coverage your content gets across online print and broadcast.

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:32.580
Now going beyond Google Analytics,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.650
you can look at tools like Parsley.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.189
This allows you to see how your content is performing in

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.474
real-time and easily explore historical trends.

00:03:40.474 --> 00:03:43.310
This is very popular with publishers who move a lot

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.430
of content and want to see traffic daily.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.045
There are lots of pre-built ways to segment this data.

00:03:50.044 --> 00:03:52.909
Now content marketing is proving to be one of

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.240
the best ways to help promote businesses both big and small.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.745
You can improve the content you create by

00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:01.555
understanding what is relevant to your target audience,

00:04:01.555 --> 00:04:04.159
what's answering the most in-demand questions and

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.829
by keeping on top of what your competitors are doing.
