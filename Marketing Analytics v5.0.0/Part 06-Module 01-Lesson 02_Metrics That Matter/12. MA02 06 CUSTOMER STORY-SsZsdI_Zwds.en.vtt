00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.294
Moving on in our brief,

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:04.410
we're going to our customer story.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.605
This is where we really start to break open the segment that we've selected.

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:14.199
For this example, we're going to target sports enthusiasts who shop at our grocery store,

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.169
because we want them to buy more snacks.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.490
For this, you're going to need to answer a series of questions.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.669
The first one I want you to think about is,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.429
where is this targets attention?

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.515
For our sports enthusiast,

00:00:29.515 --> 00:00:31.960
perhaps they're listening to sports talk radio,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.445
spending time watching ESPN.

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:36.774
Maybe they're frequent sports bars.

00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:40.314
It's also very likely that they buy their teams a peril.

00:00:40.314 --> 00:00:45.664
They may also be using their phone or the web to look up sports stats.

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:48.978
They may even have an app that gives them up to date details,

00:00:48.978 --> 00:00:50.464
about the game they're watching.

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:54.425
From here, we need to evaluate where is our effort.

00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:58.774
Let's say right now the grocery store is only sending out a circular.

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:03.750
It's one ad that goes out every Sunday to everybody in our target market,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.030
this includes almost every neighbor within a 20-mile radius.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.894
We now need to ask ourselves,

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:12.209
how effective is this effort?

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:15.364
It's really clearly not effective for this goal.

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:18.709
It's not going to meet the needs of the customer segment.

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:25.044
So from here, we really need to then evaluate where should we focus our changes.

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:28.150
In this case, we need to be launching marketing efforts in

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.335
the channels that will be capturing the attention of our sports enthusiast.

00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:34.404
Anywhere that they're spending time,

00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:37.855
we might evaluate making sure our brand is present.

00:01:37.855 --> 00:01:41.410
We also need to incentivize our high margin items.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.090
When you walk into the store,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.015
it needs to be evident that we're pushing these products.

00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:50.409
We could do this by discounting or where we place the products in the store.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.319
We also likely need to find a way to connect the sports theme to these snacks,

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.989
and that can be done using displays,

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:01.478
by demonstrating the teams that we value,

00:02:01.478 --> 00:02:07.760
or by indicating these types of connections in the display or TV ads that we're running.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.355
It's really important that our brand looks like it aligns with these sports fans.

00:02:13.354 --> 00:02:15.379
Now we need to start considering,

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.854
what should we be doing now and later.

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:20.185
Well, we know that we need to align our messaging.

00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:24.814
We know that we really need to be attractive to this audience.

00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:27.710
From here, we're really going to be looking at

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.490
the prospective customer journey and applying it to a map.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.830
We're going to do this so we can evaluate further and with more detail,

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.045
what we need to be measuring to further influence the decisions that we make,

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:47.649
and to further measure what's happening as this customer moves through this journey.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.125
Now, an easy way to do this,

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:50.550
is to set up a grid.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.675
You can do this in Excel.

00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:56.510
List all of your channels is rows along the left side,

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.854
and then create the funnel labels as columns across the top.

00:02:59.854 --> 00:03:04.514
Let's say our channels are as follows; WEB, DISPLAY,

00:03:04.514 --> 00:03:11.114
FACEBOOK, TELEVISION, RADIO, IN-STORE, PRINT and PHONE.

00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:14.520
Of course, we have our funnel: AWARENESS,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.450
INTEREST, DESIRE, ACTION and ADVOCACY.

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:23.674
Now, we simply highlight the customer journey we are going to seek to influence.

00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:26.314
Let's say this audience is watching TV,

00:03:26.314 --> 00:03:30.784
so we decide that we want to run a local commercial to drive awareness to our brand.

00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:34.909
So we know that this customer is going to start at awareness with the television.

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.060
From here, they're going to move into interest.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.969
So how do we further capture and reinforce that?

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.939
Perhaps we're going to send a direct mail campaign.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.430
We're going to run radio spots covering the deals.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.569
You might even offer a discount when you wear your game day t-shirt.

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.394
From here we're going to move them through desire and action,

00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:57.094
and will likely do that once they're in store.

00:03:57.094 --> 00:03:59.895
We create that desire again by decorating the store,

00:03:59.895 --> 00:04:02.344
moving those high margin products upfront,

00:04:02.344 --> 00:04:05.449
and making discounts really visible.

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.494
Next, we have advocacy.

00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:10.110
So we perhaps encourage loyalty cards,

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.130
because we have emails and cell phone numbers attach those loyalty cards,

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.175
which allows us to send follow-up email messaging or text messages,

00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:20.500
before the next big game.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.154
This is our reference funnel.

00:04:23.154 --> 00:04:25.914
It is the ideal path that they will take.

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:27.265
It's going to be okay,

00:04:27.264 --> 00:04:29.738
if they split off this path zig-zag,

00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:34.279
or if this path splits into multiple channels from time to time.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:40.164
Now, we look at this and we think deeply about what metrics we need to measure.

00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:44.590
We look at TV, and from here we outline what do we need to measure here.

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:48.054
How are we going to know that this TV campaign was successful?

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:50.935
Are we going to look at traffic to our website?

00:04:50.935 --> 00:04:53.435
Are we going to look at traffic in our store?

00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:55.910
What are we going to measure to understand that

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.760
that TV campaign did what it set out to do?

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.849
For direct mail, we might need to connect some dots.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.530
It could be a little harder to measure.

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:06.889
Perhaps, we've included a coupon or some other way that we can

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.824
identify that direct mail piece influenced the behavior,

00:05:10.824 --> 00:05:13.444
or we're simply looking at overall lift.

00:05:13.444 --> 00:05:17.029
We're not so concerned with each individual piece,

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.644
but rather we're okay looking at the top line.

00:05:20.644 --> 00:05:23.269
One other way that we could evaluate direct mail,

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:25.444
is if we run these campaigns often.

00:05:25.444 --> 00:05:28.000
If we did this campaign without direct mail

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.310
or to a certain segment that did not receive direct mail,

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.259
we can compare that data.

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.539
From here we move into the store.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.645
Now we need to measure how many people are coming into the store.

00:05:38.644 --> 00:05:40.609
How does that compare to our baselines?

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.170
Are there any game day shifts?

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.410
Are we seeing more traffic in response to the games?

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.765
How many people are responding to these discounts, redeeming them?

00:05:49.764 --> 00:05:54.949
We might also look at how many people are coming in wearing those game day shirt.

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.550
This is data that you can collect simply by observation.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.105
From here, we can then look at that final step,

00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:04.325
the emails and the text that we're sending out.

00:06:04.324 --> 00:06:06.305
What is the open rate on those emails?

00:06:06.305 --> 00:06:10.084
Then what is the response or engagement on the text messages?

00:06:10.084 --> 00:06:12.514
Use the customer story as a map,

00:06:12.514 --> 00:06:14.300
to guide not only your thinking,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.780
but to unlock the metrics that you want to capture at each step.
