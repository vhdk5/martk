00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
The final piece of this process is to

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:06.525
understand our testing and learning plan for the analytics brief.

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:11.289
You may feel uncertain you have everything you need to take action on this segment,

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.894
or you may find that there are still more insights required.

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:18.899
For this, we need to ask ourselves three questions.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:21.359
What should we study further?

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.044
What analysis and data do we need?

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:29.730
What should we try? Let's assume for our game day promotion,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.585
we know that we need to study what teams are favorite in our neighborhoods.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:36.179
We have to look at which team makes up the majority of

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.409
our customer or the desired customer segment that we're going after.

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:45.334
We also know that we need to reduce costs as this was part of the original ask,

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:48.770
and so we know that we need to go back and study that more.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.620
We still haven't finished all of our analysis here.

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:56.974
We need to run this again and figure out what cost reductions can come into play.

00:00:56.975 --> 00:01:01.655
Also, we know that we need to study the impact to revenue further.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:05.004
We have yet to define the actual smart goal for this,

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.640
and so we'll make note to do a deeper dive into

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.614
the actual metric by which we think we can improve revenue.

00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:17.030
We may also evaluate that we're going to need data on the best time to run a TV campaign

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.564
or information on which TV channels

00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:22.715
actually serve the customers that we're hoping to capture.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.460
We may also want to know when those games are running,

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:26.989
the schedule of events,

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:29.809
and we may even decide that we're going to change the teams we

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.960
feature based on the games as they're coming up.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.899
Now when it comes to what should we try, well,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.530
we know that we wanted to try discounting but we may also

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.594
want to try not discounting because we do need to get that revenue up.

00:01:43.594 --> 00:01:46.069
If we can sell the same amount of product without

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.469
a discount just from our promotional efforts,

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.239
well, then we're there.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.359
As you can see, a simple exercise such as

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.905
the analytic brief can unlock a lot of fantastic insight and help you

00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:01.879
pull out of the tools and into the creative storytelling and

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:07.289
creative problem-solving that end up going hand in hand with analytics.
