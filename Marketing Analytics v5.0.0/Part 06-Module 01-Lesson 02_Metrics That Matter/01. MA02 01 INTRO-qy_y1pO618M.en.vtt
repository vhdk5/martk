00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.094
It's clear that our marketing activities generate lots of data.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:06.479
So it should be easy to just pick something,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.919
track it, make graphs,

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.765
and figure out trends, right?

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:11.640
Now, of course it's not that easy.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.679
That's why I keep reinforcing the idea of identifying the metrics that matter,

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.870
and we're going to keep talking about it because this is

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.705
really the most challenging part of the process.

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:23.579
In this lesson, we're going to spend

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.794
a lot more time arriving at the correct metrics and starting to apply them.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:31.995
We're going to look at three additional approaches to evaluating the metrics to study.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:33.660
We'll look at pirate metrics,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.689
funnel metrics, and using an analytic brief.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:38.899
From there, we're going to talk about some of

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.754
the common tools that we can use to capture this data.

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:44.900
These tools are used to gather insights from social,

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.549
search, audience, engagement, and our content. Let's get started.
