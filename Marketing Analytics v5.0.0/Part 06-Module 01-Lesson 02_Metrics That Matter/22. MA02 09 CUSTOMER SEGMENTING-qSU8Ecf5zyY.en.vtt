00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
We've talked a lot about looking at data,

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:06.929
capturing metrics, and how to work through ways to solve what we want to measure.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:09.390
But when it comes to putting those metrics to work,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.660
well, we need to add in another layer of complexity.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.250
We talk a lot about segmenting and marketing.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.565
So it's time that we evaluate how we begin to measure our customer segments.

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:23.570
Consumer segment is really a way of dividing up

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.155
your consumers into different groups of like people.

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:29.150
We may have many segments,

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.820
and these segments can all perform differently.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.734
So really, we need to begin to measure how one segment performs against a piece of data.

00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:40.835
We may have a lifetime value that is different

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:44.570
for each segment of consumers that come to our business.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.594
Let's get on the same page.

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:50.570
Segmentation is really a process of taxonomy.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.689
It's a way that we divide something into parts, and really,

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:57.574
it's a way that we begin to separate the market into sub-markets.

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:00.380
Generally, within a consumer segment,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.525
you have homogeneous within, and heterogeneous between.

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:07.359
This really means that good segments are going to have

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.420
customers that are all very similar within that segment,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.840
and very dissimilar to customers of other segments.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.780
We can have segments based on attributes of customers,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.754
such as those that we looked at earlier,

00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:21.420
ones who'd like sports or fitness.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.930
We may also have segments based on very simple business rules.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.140
For example, you might view your segment as those that use your product a lot,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.739
a little bit, very little,

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:36.299
or not at all.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.244
Alternatively, you get segment based on recency,

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:42.939
frequency, and monetary variables.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.250
How recently did a customer purchase?

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.109
How frequently does a customer purchase?

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.775
How much did they spend?

00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:53.535
We could take those consumer groups,

00:01:53.534 --> 00:01:55.244
those that frequent purchase,

00:01:55.245 --> 00:01:57.210
those that spend a lot,

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.244
or those that we see often,

00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:01.070
and create segments for them.

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.494
Segments are important in marketing,

00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:06.454
and just as important in our marketing analytics.

00:02:06.454 --> 00:02:09.530
If we can find all the people that are alike, well,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.340
then we can assume that their behaviors are also very much alike.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.250
So when we measure things and make decisions,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.664
we can expect that those decisions impact that entire group similarly.

00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:23.509
Take abandonment for example,

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.039
or churn, or cancellation,

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:29.144
or any metric that suggests customers are leaving your funnel.

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:31.805
That metric exists as an aggregate.

00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:35.420
So you can say, "Our business has a 10 percent churn rate."

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.229
In other words, we can expect for every 10 customers we get,

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.284
to have one of them go away.

00:02:41.284 --> 00:02:44.509
But what if we slice that data by segment?

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:49.280
What have we discovered, that customers who use our product five times,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.185
there are in a high-use segment,

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:53.780
have only a one percent churn rate.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.140
Well, that tells us a completely different story.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.629
Now, just as we said,

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.375
there is no one size of framework.

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:03.500
There is no one size fits all customer.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.854
By understanding these segments,

00:03:05.854 --> 00:03:09.619
we can really look at data in a more granular fashion,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.870
while still making it actionable.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.310
With that churn rate,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.330
we know that we can invest in ways to influence other customer groups,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.875
maybe the medium use groups,

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.800
to arrive at higher usage of our product,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.370
because we know that if we can move them into that group,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.615
the churn rate will go down.

00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:31.025
I can't take action on the results of an individual person.

00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:32.780
That's why segmentation is important.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.640
If we look at one person,

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.109
that's far too granular.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.645
So we need to take them as a group so that we can

00:03:38.645 --> 00:03:42.050
understand the similar behaviors that link them together.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.320
Now, segments reveal themselves differently.

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.989
You may have a segment sensitive to price,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.290
a segment that prefers a particular marketing channel,

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:55.129
or a segment that requires a certain style of communication.

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.509
Start thinking about how you can layer segmentation into your analytics.

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.429
What insights might it provide?

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.080
What will it reveal?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.840
The more data that we can attribute to a segment,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.719
the better decisions we can make in influencing

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.719
that segment to achieve our marketing objectives.
