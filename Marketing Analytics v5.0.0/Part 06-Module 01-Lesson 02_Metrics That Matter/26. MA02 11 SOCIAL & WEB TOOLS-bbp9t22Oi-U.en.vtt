00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
A lot is happening in social, on blogs,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.695
and around the web at large,

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:07.830
and that information is incredibly valuable.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.160
Social and web monitoring tools come in to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.699
help you understand all sorts of interesting data sets.

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.394
For example, you can understand the number of mentions that your brand has.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:23.429
You can take and look at this data and qualify it by time period,

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.355
by segment, and even message penetration.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:29.670
For example, if you're running a particular campaign,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.825
you might understand how far that campaign had reach.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:37.920
So you may have a particular hashtag that you've attached to this campaign,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.060
and now you can see how many mentions this has gathered all around the web.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.179
You can also identify the locations of

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:47.390
these conversations and where they're most concentrated.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.210
There are even ways to use these tools to identify

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.480
the types of conversations happening around your brand.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:55.250
You can take this data,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.755
and without having to look at every conversation,

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:00.920
evaluate the sentiment around those conversations.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.570
Is it primarily positive?

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.994
or primarily negative?

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:05.484
Or is it just neutral?

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:09.019
You can also look at word clouds to understand whether people are talking about

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:13.405
a particular product or service that you offer more so than anything else.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:17.239
There are also ways to look at what influencers are participating in

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:22.435
these conversations or how influential that people talking about you are.

00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:26.329
There's also data on what publications are writing about you,

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.944
and within that you can see the specific journalists or bloggers

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:33.784
and even the trends and themes about those particular journalists.

00:01:33.784 --> 00:01:36.289
You can see what topics they tend to write about or

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.425
where they typically spend their time around the web.

00:01:39.424 --> 00:01:43.534
There's also ways to use these tools to identify trending topics.

00:01:43.534 --> 00:01:46.250
This way you can attach yourself to conversations that are

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.489
happening around the web as they make sense to your brand.

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:52.879
There's also ways to organize your customer information.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.569
You can gain insights about individual segments,

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.244
and see what their likes and interests are to help you better tailor your messaging.

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:04.939
You also have a way to identify thought leaders and influencers so you can reach out and

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.069
start thinking about how they can participate in

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.025
campaigns that you might be deciding to run.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:14.405
We can also gather aggregate insights from all of the major platforms.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:16.925
So you'll have your native data from Twitter,

00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:20.120
Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook for example.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.289
So you can use a tool like HootSuite or Sprout Social to help aggregate

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.479
those metrics for your channel efforts and see

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.244
what's going on across each of those platforms.

00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:34.925
Now, you can also use this data for both retroactive insights and proactive insights.

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:37.670
You can look at what happened and figure out why,

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.369
or you can start thinking about where to take the brand

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.525
based on the share of conversations that are happening around the web.

00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:45.890
Now, these insights can be passed through

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:50.614
the same frameworks that we've evaluated to help us identify action.

00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:53.300
Let's talk about some popular tools.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.615
One of the more high-end tools that you can look at is Sales Force Marketing Cloud.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:01.219
Now, there are many individual products within

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.909
the marketing cloud such as Social Studio and Data Studio.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.990
Here you have access to monitoring and brand visibility as well as

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.325
features that can extend that data into your initiatives around paid marketing.

00:03:13.324 --> 00:03:15.169
This is a fairly market leading product,

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.479
but it's also fairly expensive.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.215
Moving on, there's HootSuite.

00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:23.060
HootSuite is a social relationship software.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.780
It started as a way to automate posts across multiple platforms,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.180
and now it's evolved to help you execute

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.969
your marketing campaigns across multiple channels.

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.925
It'll have dashboards with all summary metrics

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:37.850
to give you the tools to track trends in the industry,

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.344
as well as measure what's going on with your specific campaigns.

00:03:41.344 --> 00:03:44.240
Now, this tool tends to be favored by brands that do

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.455
a lot of customer service via their social channels.

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:51.260
Now, Sysomos is a unified insights driven

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:56.780
social platform that gives you a way to look at search across many areas.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.909
Here you can discover, listen, publish, engage,

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:06.020
and analyze all of the data across both your earned and owned media.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.534
This tool has a lot in it.

00:04:07.534 --> 00:04:09.770
You can measure mentions of your brand,

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.770
your competitors or what's going on at

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.579
your industry as a whole or it'll allow you to set up

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.649
complex queries for all of

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:23.709
these less obvious use cases on things that you might want to ask of the data sets.

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:26.449
Now, Sysomos does bring in data from Twitter and

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.214
all of the majority of mentions coming from blogs,

00:04:29.214 --> 00:04:31.384
news channels, and social channels.

00:04:31.384 --> 00:04:33.925
Now, a lot of these tools, Sysomos included,

00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:37.759
are only going to capture a small percentage of data from Facebook,

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.245
and that's because not all Facebook data is publicly available,

00:04:42.245 --> 00:04:45.819
and this quality will be the same across most tools.

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.730
Now, Awario is another popular tool that makes

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.485
social media and web monitoring affordable for businesses of just about any size.

00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:56.915
It starts at around $29 a month,

00:04:56.915 --> 00:05:01.160
and they have a lot of capabilities that you'd find an enterprise level tools.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.800
This is a great place to start for a smaller business.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.230
As with any marketing project,

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.129
you need to evaluate the tool that fits your requirement,

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:11.855
but I think it's really valuable.

00:05:11.855 --> 00:05:14.090
If you take the time to visit the websites of

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:17.134
these various tools and explore their features in more depth.

00:05:17.134 --> 00:05:19.459
Whether you're going to use the tool or not,

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:22.849
you'll gain a deeper awareness of the reach that these tools have,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.640
and you'll start being able to think creatively about the types of

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.939
data that's available for you to capture and start making decisions with.
