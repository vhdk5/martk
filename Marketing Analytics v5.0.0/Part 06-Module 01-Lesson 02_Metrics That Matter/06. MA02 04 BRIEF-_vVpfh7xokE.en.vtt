00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
When we go about launching the marketing campaign,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.750
we might use a creative brief or a one-page plan to

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.009
articulate the goals for that campaign and to align all of the resources.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.960
Usually, part of that brief is to evaluate what metrics we need to measure.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.600
But there's typically just one line item in

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.390
those briefs for us to describe those metrics,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.335
and I think you're coming to learn I love

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:27.304
frameworks especially when you're just getting started.

00:00:27.304 --> 00:00:30.620
There great to help focus your attention and serve as

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.535
a reference tool to keep you confident that you're on the right path.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.564
Now eventually, you're going to toss these frameworks assign.

00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:39.710
The process will become ingrained in

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.950
your behavior and you'll follow these steps innately.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.480
So let's take some time to drill deeper into another framework.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.089
One that combines the metrics with

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.485
the customer journey and a way that's more descriptive.

00:00:53.484 --> 00:00:55.649
Now, it's a bit more lengthy,

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.979
and it's a little bit more of a process,

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:04.104
but this is a great exercise to engage your mind in your next analytics projects.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:08.585
The flow of our business brief will cover our business story,

00:01:08.584 --> 00:01:12.394
our customer story, and our test and learn plan.

00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:13.599
There's a hierarchy here,

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:17.604
a natural way by which we start at the top and weave our way down.

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:22.713
Now, the brief is really just an exercise to answer a series of questions,

00:01:22.713 --> 00:01:25.819
and then we apply a customer journey map with

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.519
the metrics that we measure into that customer story section of our brief.

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:32.899
The next couple of videos, I'm going to take you

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.540
through each section and show you just how this works.
