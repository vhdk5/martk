00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
As you've seen, there are thousands of tools that help

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.915
companies collect data across a wide variety of subjects.

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:10.349
Tools make it easier for us to not only collect data,

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.074
but they give us a jump start by recommending the actions that we might want to take.

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:18.480
Many tools these days are using machine learning to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.810
detect patterns and mine giant source of data to

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:25.169
automatically identify the most actionable areas of

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.070
your business to achieve the goal that you've established.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.530
Now the tools are helpful,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.505
but they don't do all of the work.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:34.380
So I want to spend some time looking at

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.200
a few common tools by the type of data they collect and report on,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.530
so that you can gain better insights into how to leverage this data and how to start

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.450
cross referencing your datasets to deliver on what is most actionable for you.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.820
Now the most common tools will typically focus on a particular data area such as

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.460
social media and web monitoring or search

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.554
analytics or audience analysis or even content analysis.

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:01.729
When you start to evaluate tools,

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.359
a great platform to take a look at all of this is G2 Crowd.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:09.484
There you can see all of the tools available for what you're trying to accomplish,

00:01:09.484 --> 00:01:10.804
you'll see how they rank,

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:13.310
you can read reviews and determine if

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.120
that tool based on the features it has will meet your requirements.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.669
Now when you start looking at analytical tools,

00:01:19.668 --> 00:01:22.444
I want you to consider several items.

00:01:22.444 --> 00:01:25.264
First is data capture.

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:29.665
There is no tool that is going to offer 100 percent data capture.

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:34.045
Every tool have their sweet spot for the channel metrics that it's gathering.

00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:35.859
As the tools have matured,

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:39.429
many of them seem to be pretty good across most channels,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.260
but some tools are going to be really better at making sense of particular areas such

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.300
as blogs from around the web or data on very specific forums such as Reddit.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.670
The channels that you want to be measuring when you're

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.489
starting out are going to be where you think most

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.859
of your audiences or where most of

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.295
the audience that you want to be capturing is spending their time.

00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:05.230
From here, you need to think about how these platforms integrate with other data sources.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.954
Can they talk to one another?

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:08.925
If you're using multiple tools,

00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:13.310
you want to understand if they can easily share that data back and forth.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.129
The easier that they share data,

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.069
the easier your job will be.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.014
Next, we need to evaluate cost.

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:22.114
How much can you spend?

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:25.189
A lot of tools are getting very expensive and it can be

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.439
really exciting to see all of these great features that a tool provides.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.849
But you have to zoom out and think about whether

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.569
the insights you gain are going to be worth what you're spending.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.359
If you can't take actions based on

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.845
that data that improve what you're earning enough to cover the tool,

00:02:42.844 --> 00:02:45.234
then there's no point in using that tool.

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:49.475
You also need to factor in the cost of changing platforms.

00:02:49.474 --> 00:02:52.909
If you're using a tool now and you want to move to a different tool,

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.699
there is a significant cost in development,

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.274
time, and training to move to that new tool.

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:04.400
Also, it's important to evaluate whether the tool is easy to use on a mobile device.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.319
When you're on the go and you're always wanting to be looking at that data every day,

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.144
it should be fairly easy to look at your summary analytics on your phone.

00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:16.340
Another really important but often overlooked piece of

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.865
a value in a tool is whether or not it has an API access.

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:23.510
This is the way the developers can gather data out of the tool so that

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:27.439
you can apply custom learnings say within your own data warehouse.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.550
You can use an API to pull down your own queries

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.275
to gather the insights that you need for your specific objectives.

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:39.740
Another thing that I like to evaluate is whether the tool has

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.890
a consistent and meaningful user interface.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.364
If the tool is hard to use or it's not laid out in a meaningful way,

00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:49.040
you're not going to use it all that often and you're not going to find

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:53.000
the information that you need to make that tool worth what you're spending.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.985
Another piece to evaluate is your workflow.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:59.575
How easy is it for you to engage other people from your team?

00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:02.569
Can you pass the insights that you're finding off easily?

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:03.919
Can you share that data?

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.794
Is the data in real time?

00:04:05.794 --> 00:04:07.069
Can you download it?

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.769
How easy is it to move and migrate that data off of the platform?

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.590
Another interesting aspect is the historical data.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.449
Sometimes when you sign up for a tool,

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.149
they can bring in historical data about your brand

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.544
even if you hadn't signed up for the tool and started monitoring for it.

00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:26.900
Now every tool has a different window by which they can look back,

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:30.484
so you'll need to evaluate what makes sense for your needs.

00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:34.735
Another really important piece is how customizable the dashboard is.

00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:37.610
Just because the way the tool is setup for

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.745
their needs doesn't necessarily make sense for your needs.

00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:43.699
Everybody likes to look at data in a different way and put

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.925
metrics next to one another in a way that's actionable for you.

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:49.985
So it's helpful when you can customize those dashboards.

00:04:49.985 --> 00:04:53.840
Also you need to consider the cross-functional use of a tool.

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:57.859
A lot of tools are going to fit into an ecosystem beyond marketing.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.220
You may have PR, legal and customer support all sharing in this tool.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.220
Then we need to think about what happens as the company grows?

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.530
Is the data in this tool portable?

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.439
Perhaps we're using one tool but after a certain size,

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:14.779
it's not going to make sense to keep using that tool.

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.739
How are we going to get that data out and is it possible?

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.960
Now when you look on the web and read about these tools,

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:23.495
honestly a lot of them sound very similar.

00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:26.000
They seem to use a lot of generic language to help

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.569
explain what their tool does and all of the benefits.

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.620
Be sure that you're evaluating tools based on your specific requirements.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.350
Make a list of the questions that you're trying to answer

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.290
and be sure that the tool can give you those insights.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.175
Be sure to use resources like G2 crowd to refine those options.

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:45.509
Take your time, do the research,

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:50.399
and you'll be well on your way to finding the perfect tools for your needs.
