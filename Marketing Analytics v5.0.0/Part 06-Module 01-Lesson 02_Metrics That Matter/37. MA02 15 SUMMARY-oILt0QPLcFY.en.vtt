00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.919
Nice work on completing another in-depth lesson on marketing analytics.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:06.299
Now in this lesson,

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.719
we talked about the metrics that we need to be looking at daily and learned

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.485
the pirate metrics model to help us remember where to focus our attention.

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:16.189
We studied the customer journey and evaluated

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.710
the need to create an analytic brief to help us unlock

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.885
the questions we need to be asking and the

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:24.035
answers we need to be solving through the analytics process.

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:27.109
We learned the importance of customer segments and how we use

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.469
those segments to make our data even more actionable.

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:35.314
We also looked at a variety of tools to gather meaningful data in social media,

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:38.989
the web, search, audience, and content.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.469
All of this information is essential to the day-to-day responsibilities of any marketer,

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.390
and you're continuing to build the skills necessary to have

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.600
the confidence to execute on your next analytics project.
