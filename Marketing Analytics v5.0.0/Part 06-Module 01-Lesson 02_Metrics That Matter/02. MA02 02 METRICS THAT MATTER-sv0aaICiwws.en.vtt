00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
At this point, we've established that we need to be looking at our metrics daily.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.810
Not every analytics project is going to be about a specific initiative,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.060
you might be running many initiatives and you

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.640
need to be capturing the health of your marketing.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.109
So to get there,

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.559
let's talk about the five critical areas to any business

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:24.000
regardless of where you're at and what you're trying to capture.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.640
First, we have acquisition.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.640
This is the process of converting your customer.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.225
The customer comes in from any number of channels,

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:34.829
and once they arrive,

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.439
we move to activation.

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:40.114
This is users having a good first-time experience.

00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:42.905
From here, we have retention.

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:45.200
This is the act of keeping that customer,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.630
finding ways to make sure that they don't leave your experience.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.500
Then we have referral.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.439
These are customers telling their friends.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:57.439
From here, we have a revenue,

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:00.094
and that's the money you are bringing in.

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:04.250
Now this looks close to our funnel with a few twists,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.939
but Dave McClure, venture capitalists and angel investor,

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.329
described these areas as the pirate metrics,

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.929
named because when you take the first letter of each of the stages,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.055
it sounds well, like a pirate.

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:22.390
The goal is to identify a key metric from

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.390
each of those areas depending on what your business objective is.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.454
For a brand new product just entering the market,

00:01:29.454 --> 00:01:33.289
you can get away with focusing on qualitative metrics.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.085
For acquisition, this is,

00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:37.049
how our customers finding us?

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.840
For activation, what are our customers saying?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.105
Retention, why are customers leaving or why aren't they leaving?

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.978
What's keeping them around? For referral,

00:01:48.978 --> 00:01:51.700
would customers share this with their friends?

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.954
For revenue, are we making money?

00:01:54.954 --> 00:01:58.000
Now, if you were studying those metrics daily,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.170
you'd have a very good pulse on the health of your business.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.489
Now there's no actual qualitative data behind them,

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:07.670
but it is a good sense as you start out.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.150
As you move towards actually having a product in the market,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.420
you want to start looking at the foundational qualitative metrics.

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.914
These are the measurements that you want to be able to report on daily,

00:02:17.914 --> 00:02:22.894
as they will really describe in a qualitative sense the health of your business.

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:26.855
For acquisition, this could be your number of conversions.

00:02:26.854 --> 00:02:29.659
This will demonstrate how your business is doing,

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.659
whether you're growing or whether the trend is declining.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.549
Now, if you aren't measuring conversions,

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.150
this could be leads for example or simply visit.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.564
Whatever the objective is for your business,

00:02:40.564 --> 00:02:43.460
you will factor into that daily metric.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.560
From here, it's activation.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.390
This is the information around how much time someone is spending in your product,

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.714
your customer support ticket volume,

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:58.789
areas of your metrics that demonstrate what is happening to get that customer activated.

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:02.704
Next, you want to understand what's going on with retention.

00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:03.930
What's your churn rate?

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.265
Now sometimes retention data doesn't change all that much.

00:03:07.264 --> 00:03:10.099
But it's important that you have a pulse on it because if there was

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.149
a large uptick in customers that were canceling for example,

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.830
you know that you have a problem.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.605
These metrics are very important because they

00:03:18.604 --> 00:03:21.889
indicate that there is a problem in the health of your business,

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.404
and that's why we look at them daily.

00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:24.890
If we waited too long,

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.125
we'd miss something important.

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:31.580
From here, we look at referral and this could be conversions or

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.360
whatever other activation or acquisition data by this referral source.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.290
We look at this because we want to understand where that customer is coming from.

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:44.733
If we see a large upswing in referrals,

00:03:44.734 --> 00:03:47.034
we know we have something going on.

00:03:47.034 --> 00:03:49.060
Finally, revenue.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.539
It's important that we always understand how much money the businesses bringing in.

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.449
Now you might zoom these analytics in.

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.729
For example, it might be the revenue that you're

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.719
particularly responsible for or it could be the revenue of the whole business.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.289
But it's important that you understand this in a time-frame that makes sense.

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:10.039
You could be looking at revenue by day over the last seven days,

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:14.859
over the last 30 days or the trend for what's going to happen that month.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.220
Now, once you've started to invest in actual marketing spend,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.030
you want to increase your focus and start layering in more metrics.

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:28.219
For acquisition, you might bring in your conversion rate and your cost per acquisition.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.090
This is important because you want to understand how many customers are

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:33.979
arriving for the campaigns that you're

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.965
creating and how much you're spending to bring in those customers.

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:41.389
Typically, we have a intense focus on that cost per acquisition.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.729
That's a number that we always want to be bringing down.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.210
The more customers we can bring in for less money, the better.

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:49.324
So it's important to have a pulse on that.

00:04:49.324 --> 00:04:54.024
For activation, now we're starting to look at our customer lifetime value.

00:04:54.024 --> 00:04:56.419
We want that number to be going up,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.960
we're finding ways to influence how valuable this customer is.

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:02.739
If that value is dropping, we have a problem.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.569
For retention, this is again typically

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.454
a churn rate but we can also look at how much we're recapturing.

00:05:09.454 --> 00:05:10.789
So as we mature,

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.980
we are going to be looking at ways that we take customers that are

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.400
canceling or attempting to cancel and recapture them.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.739
We're also looking at our email open rates,

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.134
because this helps identify the health of our messaging and whether we're resonating.

00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:25.129
As you look at these metrics daily,

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:30.050
you get a good sense of the health of your communication with your existing customers.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.740
For referral, we might have an affiliate program that we're running.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.960
So we'd want to check in on that growth rate.

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:39.664
Another piece of data that can change by day,

00:05:39.665 --> 00:05:41.360
an affiliate could launch something new that

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.470
dramatically changes what happens in that channel.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.610
For revenue, well, we might start looking at something called our compound monthly or

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.759
our compound annual growth rate which essentially helps

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.209
us understand how we're trending against a baseline.

00:05:56.209 --> 00:06:00.469
Your key metrics should act as the vital signs to help you understand

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.110
the overall health of your product and serve to

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.710
influence the changes that you make to your marketing strategy.

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:09.199
Use the pirate metrics model as

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.485
a simple framework to see if you're looking at your most important metrics,

00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:16.210
and doing so everyday.
