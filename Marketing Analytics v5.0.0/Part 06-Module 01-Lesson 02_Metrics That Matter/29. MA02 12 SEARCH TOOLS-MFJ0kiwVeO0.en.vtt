00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019
Another area of the Web that we can monitor is our search analytics.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.649
Search analytics help you understand your organic search,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.750
but they also can reveal opportunities around what you'll be doing with your paid search.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.343
When we think about search analytics,

00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:21.149
we can primarily use them to identify performance on particular search topics.

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:24.269
We can use this in many different ways.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.759
For starters, we can identify which topics are driving a lot of our search traffic.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.730
We can see where we rank on various keywords.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.269
We can also see what terms are popular for our brand.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.275
Now, we can use this data to identify competitive datasets.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:43.548
So we can start looking at what are we ranking for,

00:00:43.548 --> 00:00:46.009
and what are our competitors ranking for.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.349
But as we look at this even deeper,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.329
we can start to identify trends such as what people are most searching for.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.545
This can give us insights into the type of content that we could be creating.

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:01.160
Now in addition, we also have the ability to use all of

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.155
this information to start selecting terms that we can use for our paid advertising.

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:09.905
If we know that people are searching primarily on a specific topic,

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:15.530
now we can drive that both in our organic efforts as well as our paid efforts.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.719
Let's talk about the top tools.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.144
One of the first tools in the space is Google Trends.

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:23.989
This tool provides the ability to easily

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:27.844
identify the most popular search trends along with the ability

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:31.189
to quickly and easily search and explore what consumers

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.730
are interested in based on what they're typing into Google.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.560
You'll find this at trends.google.com.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.504
Now, when you get into this tool,

00:01:39.504 --> 00:01:41.719
you'll find that you have the ability to look at

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.620
particular terms and compare how they're performing to other terms.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.510
Perhaps I want to identify whether removing a red wine stain from carpet,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.770
is more or less popular than removing a grape juice stain from carpet.

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:56.909
This could influence what article I'd want

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.344
to write if I owned a carpet cleaning business.

00:01:59.344 --> 00:02:04.010
You can also see how these concepts perform regionally and you'll also see

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.900
what concepts are related or trending in association with those keywords.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.469
Now YouTube also has a similar trends tool and

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.234
that exists at youtube-trends.blogspot.com.

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:19.374
Same idea, you can identify trending topics,

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:24.530
trending videos, see what content is most popular and what content is most viewed.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.560
This can help you in deciding where you want to participate in

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.314
conversations or the types of videos that you might want to create.

00:02:31.314 --> 00:02:34.909
Now, as we go deeper into our analytics efforts,

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.484
we can look at Google AdWords.

00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:40.760
Now primarily we think of Google AdWords as a tool to run promotions,

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:44.884
but within it are very helpful tools around keywords.

00:02:44.884 --> 00:02:48.579
With these tools we can look at the popular keyword searches,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.980
identify the volume of those searches and see how

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.994
competitive the landscape is for those keywords.

00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:56.560
Another tool I really like is SEMrush.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.795
I use this tool a lot in my organic research.

00:02:59.794 --> 00:03:03.324
SEMrush allows you to look at all sorts of search data.

00:03:03.324 --> 00:03:07.554
You can identify a particular keyword and see how popular that keyword is.

00:03:07.555 --> 00:03:10.569
You can also see who's buying ads on that keyword,

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.709
and it will even allow you to see the actual ads that are being displayed,

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.740
which allows you to look at the ad text that people are using so

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.890
you can begin to influence the types of ads that you want to run.

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.394
It also allows you to do a competitive analysis.

00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:27.564
You can even track keywords that you're hoping to gain traffic for.

00:03:27.564 --> 00:03:30.759
As you begin to think about the content that you want to run,

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:33.879
you'll have the ability to look at related keywords.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.579
Additionally, you can use it to identify related keywords which is

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.415
helpful in finding the wide space for new ideas to generate content.

00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:45.859
As you can see, some tools are helpful not just to

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.220
evaluate and report on metrics but also to

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.710
identify and research concepts surrounding

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.955
the marketing and help influence decisions about your marketing campaigns,

00:03:55.955 --> 00:03:58.810
your content, and so on.
