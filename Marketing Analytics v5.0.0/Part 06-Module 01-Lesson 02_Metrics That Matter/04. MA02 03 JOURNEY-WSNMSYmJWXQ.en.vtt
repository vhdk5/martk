00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
A lot of online marketing revolves around

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.689
encouraging a direct response from a perspective customer.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.179
We'll show them an advertisement, a tweet,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.059
or a special offer via an email and then measure

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.525
success based on the click and the subsequent conversion.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:19.304
This is what's referred to as last click attribution.

00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:23.070
The entire value of the customers conversion is placed on

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.089
the marketing channel or campaign that delivered that customer.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.739
Last click attribution is easy to measure,

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.640
because it involves a very clear process that the user takes.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.234
However, this is typically a very flawed method.

00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:40.685
We know that customers take a much larger journey.

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:46.179
So it's irresponsible if we focus our marketing analytics efforts on that last click.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.325
The path the customer takes through your funnel could be a loop,

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:51.605
a spiral, a zigzag, and so on.

00:00:51.604 --> 00:00:56.154
They can dart in and out of your funnels and others seem to just appear.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:59.600
The time they spend at each step is variable and

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.790
some consumers may inexplicably spend time in each step simultaneously.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.620
Perhaps they're hovering over the checkout button while reassessing whether they're sure,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.670
they're in the right place.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.129
We can't perfectly model human behavior with

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:22.399
a two-dimensional image of a funnel or the customer journey. Think about it this way.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.660
Have you ever tried to use a different brands loyalty card at a grocery store.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.950
So you're at one store and you're trying to use the card for another or

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.260
perhaps you put in your branded gas card at the wrong gas station.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.590
You're now immediately aware that you've trick yourself into

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.939
going down the wrong path to purchase at the wrong place.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.784
You've ignored the signs but it's almost the same thing.

00:01:46.784 --> 00:01:51.034
Then you toss your loyalty out the window and make the purchase anyway.

00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:55.149
What I'm getting at is that the customer path is really illogical,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.780
and if you really start to think about

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.500
all the various avenues by which a customer comes to purchase,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.694
it's going to be really complex.

00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:05.389
That's why when it comes to marketing analytics,

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.810
we need to simplify it by thinking about things as they

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.199
relate to the buyer's mindset and how that maps to our funnel.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.149
Our goal is just to look at the most common paths.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.700
We're setting everything up with our analytics in

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.669
anticipation of a user going through each step,

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.224
and when we do this we'll capture the majority.

00:02:25.224 --> 00:02:28.444
We'll be ready to measure those who zig and those who zag,

00:02:28.444 --> 00:02:31.009
and we'll let the analytics tools fill in the gaps.

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.799
We're not terribly concerned if a user skips

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.085
a blog article or if they didn't sign up for our email campaign.

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:39.575
So long as they have the opportunity,

00:02:39.574 --> 00:02:43.429
we measured it, and that they eventually make that purchase.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.034
So the framework by which we're evaluating the buyer, this marketing funnel,

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:50.659
this journey is meant to be flexible,

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.465
and it's meant to be measured in a flexible manner.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.750
We really just want to describe the most common path.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.555
So don't feel overwhelmed if you can't attribute

00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:02.705
a measurement for every possible journey or touch point.

00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:05.120
Your goal is to cover the big picture.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.474
In doing so, you're still going to support

00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:12.094
the erratic customer who bounces around your funnel like a pinball.

00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:15.995
We call what we're building the reference experience.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.530
That is how the customer wants to navigate,

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.169
not necessarily how you're currently set up for

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.409
the average customer in your target segment.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.530
So when it comes to picking data across the journey,

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.805
which we're going to do in a bit,

00:03:28.805 --> 00:03:33.330
just think about the most simplified and most common paths.
