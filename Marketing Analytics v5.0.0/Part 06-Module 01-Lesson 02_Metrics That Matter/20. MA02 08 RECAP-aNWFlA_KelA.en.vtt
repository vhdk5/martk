00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
At this point, we've covered a fair bit of information.

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.764
So let's take a quick moment to review it together.

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:10.800
We talked about the metrics that matter and learned that we should be looking at

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.865
the following areas of our business daily using pirate metrics.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.684
This covers acquisition, activation,

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.474
retention, referral, and revenue.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:23.670
As we advance in our business and our skills,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.270
we'll be layering in more metrics to review each morning.

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.019
We also looked at how the customer journey works and how we need to create

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.009
a reference journey to figure out what we really need to be measuring.

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:37.224
We then studied the analytics brief,

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:41.329
a framework that helps us better decipher how to study and apply

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.619
metrics as well as use analytic thinking across our business story,

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.144
our customer story, and our test and learn plan.

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:52.040
All of these pieces contribute to your skills,

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.359
and we'll help you decipher how to take action on your marketing analytics objectives.
