00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.533
Crafting the right message requires an in-depth understanding of your audience,

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.894
and their needs, expectations, and behaviors.

00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:12.000
When it comes to gathering insights about our customers,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.865
there's an endless array of tools available to you.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:19.109
This is likely one of the most saturated areas for data sources.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.669
Now, before you look at the tools,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.255
let's talk specifically about what we want to measure

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:27.945
within the typical insights whenever we're looking at our audience.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:31.920
I once attended a lecture that use the acronym audience to model

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.689
what insights you want to capture about that audience. I'll share it with you.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:39.464
It starts with analysis.

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:41.115
Who is this audience?

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:47.030
Primarily, what segment or market area are we looking to capture or gather insights on?

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.279
This could be one of our customer segments,

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:54.410
say that sport enthusiast or it could be one of our high value customer segments.

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.769
It might also be segments that we want to pursue,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.179
markets that you want to enter.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.590
For example, perhaps we want to go after people who are environmentally conscious.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.630
Next, is you for understanding.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:10.269
What is the audience's knowledge and attitude towards our brand?

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:12.420
Do they have any familiarity with us?

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.040
We want to measure if they've been made aware of our brand,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.620
and if so, how?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.579
We can also measure the attitudes towards our brand typically from those who are existing

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.409
or past customers or we can simply look at those who talk about our brand,

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.375
but have never made any purchases.

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.435
From here, we have D, for demographics.

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:35.329
This is all the information about your audiences age,

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.274
gender, location, education, and income.

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:43.280
You can further refine your audience segments using your demographic variables.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.930
For example, I can target

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.435
high-income sports enthusiasts as well as targeting low income sports enthusiasts.

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:53.210
Now, we move to I, for interest.

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.414
What does the audience interested in?

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:58.830
Sure? Sports enthusiasts might add an aggregate,

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.685
be interested in sports in general,

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:03.695
but they might also have other relevant interests.

00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:06.859
Lets say that 70 percent of our customer audience with

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.110
an affinity sports also spent a lot of time talking about fishing.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.625
Well, now we know that we have another avenue by which to engage and reach this consumer.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:20.134
We also need to evaluate what interests them and our brand.

00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:21.590
Why are they reading our content?

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.990
Why are they sharing it and interacting with it?

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.320
It's important that we understand what's motivating them.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.094
Let's move to E, for environment.

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:32.044
Where does the audience spend time?

00:02:32.044 --> 00:02:33.919
We need to know where to reach them.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.619
So if we started the environment that they're invested in,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.985
we'll get a good idea of where we can find them and how to message to them.

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:43.840
Let's move to N, for needs.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.634
What does this audience need and how do we as accompany answer that need?

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:51.370
We might directly service that need because we have

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.914
the solution or we simply show up in an area where they're looking for that need.

00:02:55.914 --> 00:02:58.704
We might simply help them find that need.

00:02:58.705 --> 00:03:01.645
C is for customization.

00:03:01.645 --> 00:03:03.230
How are we adding value?

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.829
How do we cater and adjust our messaging?

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.855
Remember, we always want to be serving the right message to the right customer.

00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:15.639
So we want to look for data points that give us insights into how we can speak to them.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.454
Do we need to adjust the message because this audience uses a particular style of slang?

00:03:20.455 --> 00:03:23.580
Perhaps, they engage with certain types of content themes.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.495
We're really looking for what's in this content that they find valuable.

00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:32.435
Now finally, we have E for expectations.

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:35.960
What are both the stated and unstated expectations

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.540
that the audience has for their interactions with your brand?

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.800
So we analyze all of this data to influence the aspects of our marketing strategy,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.830
and this data can come from a number of sources.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.500
We can pull some data from Google analytics,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.395
capturing behavior and demographic information.

00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:59.090
We can also model what content they're consuming and where they're finding that content,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.974
which will help evaluate where there's consumer spending their time online.

00:04:02.974 --> 00:04:05.814
But there's a lot more rich data for us to capture.

00:04:05.814 --> 00:04:09.680
Native tools such as Twitter and Facebook will also reveal

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.930
deep insights about your audience and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.735
can answer many of the questions that we've outlined.

00:04:14.735 --> 00:04:17.360
But you also have questions that cannot be answered

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.824
simply by studying the behaviors and patterns of the segment.

00:04:20.824 --> 00:04:24.139
So you might want to run voice of the consumer surveys to

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.949
capture insights into the specific questions that you might have.

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.539
Surveys are a valuable source of qualitative feedback that you can tie to

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.250
analytics data to connect with what an audience says versus what it actually does.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.889
Now, popular tools for this are Google surveys and SurveyMonkey.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.849
Google surveys allows you to access a readily available focus group.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.780
You get numerous results rather

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:50.704
quickly based on the questions that you're hoping to answer.

00:04:50.704 --> 00:04:53.839
In fact, you may have seen these types of survey questions pop

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:57.229
up as ads before watching a YouTube video.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.484
Most commonly, they ask Which brands you might recognize

00:05:00.483 --> 00:05:04.114
or which brands that you've seen advertisements for in the last month?

00:05:04.115 --> 00:05:06.860
This helps accompany understand if they're reaching

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.865
the audience that they're hoping to be reaching.

00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:12.590
Now, look through each question you need to answer in

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:16.819
the audience acronym and identify which tools you can gather that data from.

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.569
For any gaps, explore the marketing tools ecosystem to find

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.969
a vendor that can provide that data until you

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.400
have a complete picture of the audience you're targeting.
