00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
Remember, our analytics need to be actionable.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.370
Oftentimes, we're moving away from looking at past data,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.969
and starting to use the analytics process to evaluate what we need to be doing now.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.175
Just like our hypothesis testing,

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.304
the process of creating a brief,

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:21.045
gives us a way to study things in a focused manner to generate actionable insights.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:25.739
The act of simply reflecting and studying your business as it exists now,

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.589
can be a really important analysis.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.119
Now the business story lays out relevant customer segments to consider,

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:36.239
and describes which ones to go after and why.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.545
Our business story is going to answer two questions.

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:45.155
What relevant actionable segments do we have access to?

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:48.009
Which ones should we pursue?

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.939
Now we'll talk in more depth about customer segments later.

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:56.479
But ultimately, we're trying to evaluate where we want to take action.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.244
Marketing is really about changing the way someone behaves.

00:01:00.244 --> 00:01:02.809
Our business story is about figuring out

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.530
which behaviors inside of a customer segment are going to be the easiest to change,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.049
so they adopt the goal or the conversion that we want them to take.

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.259
Let's go back to our hypothetical grocery store.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.740
Let's say that we've been asked by senior management to

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:22.144
look for ways to increase revenue and reduce costs.

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:24.774
Honestly, this is really the most frequent asked,

00:01:24.775 --> 00:01:27.020
it just often comes flavored differently.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.689
So we start by figuring out which segment of

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.575
our customers will bring us the best opportunity to take action.

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:35.665
We know from the biometrics,

00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:38.465
that we're looking at our daily numbers.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.984
So we're going to see customer lifetime value.

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:44.155
So we will be very familiar with what that value is.

00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:47.359
Now we're going to come to learn later that we can

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.719
actually model that value by segment, we'll get there.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:56.200
But for now, if we know that we can increase the lifetime value of our customer,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.055
that'll get us one step of the way towards increasing revenue.

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:05.030
So we look and determine that the most actionable segments of customers that we have,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.164
are those that have a high affinity for sports.

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:12.734
We know that they frequent the store for snacks such as soda, chips, and dips.

00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:15.860
We know that these are our highest margin items.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.390
We may also have another customer segment that has a high affinity for say, fitness.

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.334
Their frequenting bottled water and sports drinks,

00:02:23.335 --> 00:02:25.055
also high margin items.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:28.805
These are our highest and most relevant segments.

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:33.319
So from here, we need to analyze which segment we should pursue.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.854
Are we going after sports or fitness?

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:38.044
Well, if it was right after the New Year,

00:02:38.044 --> 00:02:39.604
we might choose fitness.

00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:42.693
Why? Well, because it's going to be the most actionable,

00:02:42.693 --> 00:02:47.125
most people are making New Year's resolutions about their fitness goals.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:51.104
If we're coming in a football season with the superb months away,

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.574
we might identify that this is the most actionable segment.

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:57.424
You see what we're doing here? We're thinking outside the box.

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:00.005
We're applying insights from the world around us,

00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:03.185
not just the analytics toolkit that we have in front of us.

00:03:03.185 --> 00:03:06.664
So let's say, that we're going in the football season.

00:03:06.664 --> 00:03:10.939
Now we know that we're going to be targeting sports enthusiasts,

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.789
because we're going to want them to buy more drinks.

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.614
Again, we always want to understand the action that we're going to be steering.

00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:20.185
So we need them to buy more sports drinks,

00:03:20.185 --> 00:03:22.254
more soda, and more chips.

00:03:22.254 --> 00:03:23.914
So there's our hypothesis.

00:03:23.914 --> 00:03:28.354
We hypothesize that we can increase our revenue if we

00:03:28.354 --> 00:03:33.484
influence the behaviors of this sports enthusiast segment.

00:03:33.485 --> 00:03:38.015
We also need to actually decide by what value we can increase revenue.

00:03:38.014 --> 00:03:40.519
As we know from how we set smart goals,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.655
we need to have something that's measurable.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:46.354
We can help arrive at that value as we move through this brief.

00:03:46.354 --> 00:03:47.659
You'll see how later,

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.329
when we move to the stage of testing and learning.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.870
The overall goal here, is to think about the narrative elements.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.419
What story can we tell about our business,

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.850
through the customers or the target markets,

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.430
that we have immediate and actionable access to?
