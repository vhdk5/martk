00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Now that we know how data are collected on a site,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.519
it's helpful to take a look at what Google Analytics does with

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:08.849
that data before it appears in the Google Analytics reports.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.794
Having that background will help you work with the Google Analytics data.

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.634
Here are four main components of the analytic system.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:19.275
The data collection, data processing,

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:21.734
data configuration, and reporting.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:24.719
As we discussed, a piece of JavaScript code will

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.824
send the data from a website to Google Analytics.

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:30.419
In order to make Google Analytics work properly,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.460
you need code on every page of your website.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.439
Talk to your web developer to help you out with that.

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:41.449
Or refer to the link below with the information on how to add the code yourself.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.850
Once the code is on your pages,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.230
data on every interaction of the user with that page will be sent to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:53.149
the Google servers and you will hear people refer to that data as hits.

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.909
Google then processes the data it receives.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.099
It basically dissects the hit information it gets into pieces and stores

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.980
the data in a structured fashion so that it can put

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.179
the data back together in a useful way later on.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.040
In this step, Google Analytics applies configurations or settings from the account owner.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.110
For instance, when you or your developer sets up your account in Google Analytics,

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.819
you may apply filters.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.839
An example of a filter would be one that filters out all the data that come from

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.240
your internal traffic or from people who access your site from inside your company.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.199
Once this filter is applied,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.745
the data you filtered out can no longer be accessed.

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:37.820
You will never see that data in your Google Analytics account.

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.229
So, these settings or configurations that get applied here are permanent.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.305
But Google Analytics allows you to create different views with different filters applied.

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:51.260
Then when you go to your Google Analytics account,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.540
you will see different views based on the filters you or your developer applied.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.665
In the example, for the Google merchandise store,

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:01.760
you see three different views.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.850
Looking at the user data in these different views,

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:07.459
it looks like there's actually no filters applied.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.219
But it's good to have different view setup in case

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.264
you decide later that filters are necessary.

00:02:13.264 --> 00:02:16.159
This account setup is fairly straightforward.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.349
You have a master view, basically,

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.269
the view you will access the most,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.495
that is where you would have applied the filters that are important to you.

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:25.189
Then there is a test view.

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.930
This view could be used to look at a part of your site,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.605
for instance, when you're testing a new design.

00:02:30.604 --> 00:02:33.125
Then there is the raw data view.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:36.425
It's a good idea to always keep a raw data view.

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:39.290
Once you apply a filter to any data,

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.049
that data you filter out is lost permanently.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.830
So, having this raw data view allows you to always come back

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.105
to the data in case you accidentally filtered out something you still want to see.

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:52.629
After processing and configuration,

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.969
the data are reported in the Google Analytics interface.

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.189
Now that we know what goes on behind the scenes,

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.099
let's take a look at the Google Analytics interface and get oriented.
