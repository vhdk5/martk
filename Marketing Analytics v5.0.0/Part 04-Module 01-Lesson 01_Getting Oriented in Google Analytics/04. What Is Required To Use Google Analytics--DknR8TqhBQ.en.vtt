00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
Google Analytics reports on all the interactions of users with a site or an app.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.403
However, in order for that to happen the owner of a site

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:13.640
needs to integrate Google Analytics code in the web site or app.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.039
Google Analytics code is a piece of

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.969
Javascript that gets integrated in the rest of the code of the site.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:23.480
Every page of a website needs to have that code in order

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.454
for Google Analytics to track the activity on that page.

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:31.129
This piece of Javascript will then instruct to that page to send

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.990
relevant data to Google Analytics so that it can be included for reporting.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.454
For mobile apps the general principle is the same, however,

00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:44.825
instead of Javascript the app owner needs to integrate the code via an SDK,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:47.689
which stands for Software Development Kit,

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:49.429
a special piece of software,

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.017
app developers can integrate in their app to connect it to other platforms,

00:00:54.017 --> 00:00:56.219
in this case Google Analytics.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.719
Also, mobile apps don't really work with pages so

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.274
instead we track activities in Mobile and thus,

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:08.515
some code needs to be added to every possible activity.

00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:12.108
Once the Google Analytics code is integrated in a site or an app,

00:01:12.108 --> 00:01:14.208
Google will start collecting data on

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:18.890
the interaction of the users with the site or the app.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.239
Google makes it very easy to integrate this code in your site.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:25.969
In most cases a website developer will take care of that for you.

00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:29.208
In case you have a website that's built in a platform like,

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.314
for instance, Squarespace, Wix, WordPress, etc.

00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:36.083
integration with Google Analytics is usually already built in.

00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:38.780
In case you need to do this yourself for your site,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.950
you will find the following walk through by just in controlling at Google helpful.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.489
If you won't be the one setting this up you can skip the next video.
