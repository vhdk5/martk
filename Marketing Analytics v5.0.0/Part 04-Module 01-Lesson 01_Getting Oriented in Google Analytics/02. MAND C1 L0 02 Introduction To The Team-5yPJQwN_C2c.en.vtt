00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
We have brought together a team of expert instructors to accompany you on this journey.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.769
My name is Anke Audenaert.

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.619
I started my work in digital analytics quite a

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.324
while back when I led the market research department at Yahoo.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:17.460
I've always found digital analytics fascinating as

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.300
the insights I can gain from it make me a better marketer.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.250
I've taught analytics for many years at the Anderson School of Business at UCLA,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.365
and I'm excited to be joined by a team of experts in this Udacity nano degree program.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.370
Hi, my name is Feras Alhlou,

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:37.530
and I'm the co-founder and Principal Consultant at E-NOR,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.859
a Visual Analytics Consulting Firm.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.530
The founding of E-NOR coincided with the start of the digital analytics industry.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.615
There were no blogs, no books,

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:48.829
no nano degrees on digital analytics.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.549
We have to learn everything from the ground up and became members of

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.854
a small vibrant community who established the digital analytics industry.

00:00:56.854 --> 00:01:00.184
Our industry is now transforming at a rapid pace.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.765
I assure you if you commit to learning,

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:07.549
opportunities for growth will abound no matter where you are located geographically.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.369
I started this journey with very few resources,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.310
but committed myself to learning and working hard.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.250
I'm now so fortunate to be surrounded by a team of

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.340
world-class consultants and so excited to share our

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.950
learning with you and help you prepare for

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.004
the exciting and evolving opportunities in digital analytics.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:31.024
My name is Damaris Lasa and I'm a digital analytics consultant at E-NOR.

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:35.750
I'm thankful and honored to be a guide on your journey into the world of analytics.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.519
My fascination with analytics began during my decades long career in marketing.

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:43.099
I was working on incredible campaigns when I

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.054
noticed that marketing was evolving faster than I was.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:49.220
Working with analytics taught me to think like a scientist,

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.454
to develop and test hypotheses,

00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:55.530
and to use evidence in the form of data to elevate conversations,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.385
answer questions, and support decisions.

00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:03.290
Analytics sharpened my critical thinking skills and enhanced my problem solving skills,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.620
two core skills you need to succeed in this industry.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.504
Albert Einstein once said,

00:02:08.504 --> 00:02:11.263
"The important thing is not to stop questioning,

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:14.370
curiosity has its own reason for existing."

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.485
I advise you to ask questions,

00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:17.840
write your questions down,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.340
and treasure questions.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.025
Never stop questioning.

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:24.409
I come to web analytics from the perspective of 17 years as

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.719
a digital marketer before moving into full-time Analytics Consulting at E-nor.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.099
My interests in analytics stems from using

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.960
well-planned measurement practices to answer key questions about business objectives.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.778
During my nearly two decades in digital marketing,

00:02:38.778 --> 00:02:40.609
the one thing that has remained constant is

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.070
the competitive advantage enjoyed by individuals and

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.784
companies that leverage their data in their day-to-day business practices.

00:02:47.784 --> 00:02:53.719
Hello, my name is Scott Burnam and I'm a digital analytics consultant at E-NOR.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.740
I'm looking forward to sharing some of my insight and knowledge with you.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.990
Analytics is my second career,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.010
but I first encountered the power and flexibility of GA while working in

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.739
higher education where my experience in marketing

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.710
was gained over the course of more than 20 years.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.599
In that time, I oversaw and participated in numerous marketing initiatives,

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.194
including the transition to digital marketing,

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:21.064
retargeting campaigns, and website design and deployment.

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:23.900
I'm honored to have been hired by E-NOR as part of

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.550
their consulting team where I've been able to apply my experience to other verticals,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.510
including retail, publishing, and business to business.

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.439
Regardless of where your interest lies,

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.814
we'll teach you how to support, enhance,

00:03:37.814 --> 00:03:43.498
and even transform your approach and practices using the data you'll learn to extract,

00:03:43.498 --> 00:03:46.909
interpret, and apply to your organization.

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.014
Everyone's journey to digital analytics is unique.

00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:54.664
My own has included years of work in back end and front end web development,

00:03:54.664 --> 00:03:58.310
educational software, technical communications,

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.659
digital marketing, and search engine optimization.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.719
As analytics instructor and coach at E-NOR since 2013,

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:10.099
I've worked directly with hundreds of participants at different stages of their careers,

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.049
and learned about their challenges.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.600
There has been nothing more satisfying than to hear

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.644
students say that they understand things that they didn't before,

00:04:17.644 --> 00:04:21.259
and especially that the training helped them to do their jobs better,

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.245
and sometimes even to their career path.

00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:29.360
This nano degree program is designed to provide exactly this benefit to you,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.569
but like everything else in life that's worthwhile,

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.420
it will require focus and effort on your part.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.340
The magic starts with your commitment.
