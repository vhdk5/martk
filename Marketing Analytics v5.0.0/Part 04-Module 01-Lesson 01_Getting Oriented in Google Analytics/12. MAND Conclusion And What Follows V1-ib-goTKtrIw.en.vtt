00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
So those were some of the basics.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.360
I think you have all the background now on how Google Analytics gets data,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.979
what you find in the reports,

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.984
and how you can narrow your view to study and compare segments.

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:15.419
Let me give you a sense of what will follow in the next lessons.

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.728
As we delve into Google Analytics,

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:21.119
we like to keep the customer journey in mind or the path

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.635
a user takes from awareness all the way to action and beyond.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:30.109
Visitors on your site will be at different stages in their customer journey,

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.884
and ideally your site is set up such that it can help push the users to action,

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:36.964
whatever the desired action is.

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:41.719
We will provide you with a lot more detail on how you study all this in Google Analytics,

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.030
and you will have ample opportunity to practice.
