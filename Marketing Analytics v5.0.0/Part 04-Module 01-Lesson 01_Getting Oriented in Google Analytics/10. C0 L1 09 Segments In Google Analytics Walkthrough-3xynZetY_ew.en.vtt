00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
Now, let's take a look at where in Google Analytics you define segments.

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:08.399
We're back in the Google Analytics account for the Google merchandise store.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.810
We're in the master view,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.855
and we see the default audience overview page.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.359
By default, Google shows us the data for

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.184
all the traffic that passes through your site for the time-frame selected.

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:23.294
You'll see here that the default segment is, All Users.

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.155
But I can add a new segment here,

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:27.990
where I specify the sub-group I'd like to look at.

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.609
As you'll see here,

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.369
there are some segments that have already been defined.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.989
This is a live account,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.969
and many students have access to this account.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.284
So, some segments have already been created,

00:00:38.284 --> 00:00:41.254
but we can go ahead and create a new segment.

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.060
You can now select the shared characteristics

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.445
you want the people in your segment to have.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:50.090
You may want to select people of a certain gender and age.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.859
You can distinguish groups on the basis of the technology they use to access your site,

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.539
you can specify behavior,

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.534
you can choose the traffic sources.

00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:00.949
For example, people that found you through Facebook.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.975
You can also distinguish groups of people based on certain shopping related behaviors.

00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:09.469
Basically, you can describe the segment of users you'd like to see

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.189
data for with any dimensions that Google Analytics uses.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.539
In the advanced section,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.840
you can define even more granular segments.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.329
Let's say you're interested in the behavior of people

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.590
under 35 years old that access the site on a mobile device,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.850
because you want to understand how young users accessing the site on mobile,

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:31.024
navigate through your product pages.

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:32.900
You can select those conditions,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.350
and you can call this segment, Young mobile users.

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:41.539
Google gives you a sense here on the right of just how big my segment is,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.315
and now you can use a segment throughout your analysis.

00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:46.189
Now, when you go back to your report,

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.965
you see the data for your new segment only.

00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:52.385
You can compare that to any other segment you may have saved,

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:57.870
or you can select the All User segment to compare the total population.
