00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
So far we looked at Google Analytics data

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.450
for all the visitors of the Google merchandise store.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.865
But it is possible that you're particularly interested in one group of users,

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:10.993
say women that visit your site.

00:00:10.993 --> 00:00:14.009
You would want to see the data for just that group of people.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.524
You can do this by using segments in Google Analytics.

00:00:17.524 --> 00:00:20.745
A segment refers to a part of the total and, in this case,

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:22.410
it refers to a part of the sessions,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.989
the users or the interactions on the site.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.289
When we look at the Google merchandise store analytics account,

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.835
the default will give you a view on all of the traffic to the site.

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:33.164
In some cases, however,

00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:37.060
you'll want to see the numbers for just a subset of the traffic.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.030
There are three types of subsets or segments you can look at in Google Analytics.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.801
Segments based on certain characteristics of the user,

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:48.554
for instance, you may want to compare the behavior of men versus women,

00:00:48.554 --> 00:00:52.140
segments based on the observed interaction with the site,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.350
for instance, people who came to the checkout page,

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.210
and segments based on how a session started,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.539
more specifically, where the users came from,

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.289
through which channel they were acquired,

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.000
for instance, users landing on the site through a search ad.
