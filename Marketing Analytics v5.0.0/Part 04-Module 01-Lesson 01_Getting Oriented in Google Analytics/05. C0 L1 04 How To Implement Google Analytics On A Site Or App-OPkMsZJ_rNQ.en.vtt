00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
When you first set up your Google Analytics account,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.380
you'll be asked to choose whether you want to track a website or a mobile application.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.089
Depending on your choice,

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.800
Google Analytics will display instructions to add the correct code to collect your data.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.600
If you're tracking a website,

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.939
you receive a piece of JavaScript code that you

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.240
must add to every page on the site you want to track.

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:26.744
It's best to add this code to the top of the page before the closing head tag.

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:28.859
If your website uses a template,

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.949
you can add the code directly to the site template.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.115
If you're tracking a mobile application you will download

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:40.730
a mobile software development kit or SDK and share it with your development team.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.944
There's an SDK for the Android platform as well as iOS.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:49.594
You can learn more about tracking apps in our developer documentation.

00:00:49.594 --> 00:00:52.039
Once you add the code to your site,

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.744
you should start to see data immediately in the real-time reports.

00:00:55.744 --> 00:01:00.019
But there are other ways to add the Google Analytics tracking code to a site.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.200
One way is using a tag management tool.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.840
If you're unfamiliar with tag management it's

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.390
a fairly new technology that makes it easy to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.655
control and implement different types of JavaScript tags like the Google AdWords tag,

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.885
DoubleClick tags or the Google Analytics tag.

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:21.380
Visit the Google Tag Manager Help Center to learn more about this technology.

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:23.420
In addition to tag management,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.594
some platforms also make implementation

00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:29.509
easier by providing plug-ins to simplify the tagging process.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.850
Plug-ins on sites like Blogger,

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.879
WordPress or Drupal simply require you to input

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:36.229
your Analytics ID into

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.555
the administrative settings and the platform takes care of the tagging from there.

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:43.990
So as you just heard from Justin,

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:48.259
in order for Google Analytics to track and monitor behavior in your site,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.390
you need to add Google Analytics tracking code to your website.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.680
Justin explained how there are

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.280
three different ways of getting the code implemented on your site.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.449
First, you can paste the tracking code straight into the code of your site.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.129
Or you can add the tracking code to the Google Tag Manager.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.344
Google Tag Manager is basically a container that you implement on your site.

00:02:14.344 --> 00:02:16.034
Once the container is there,

00:02:16.034 --> 00:02:18.044
you can add tags to it.

00:02:18.044 --> 00:02:21.049
Google Analytics code creates tags and you can

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.140
let Tag Manager manage this process for you.

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:25.399
In our next course,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.569
you will learn more about how precisely this works.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.810
Lastly, some platforms allow you to use plugins.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.724
For instance, if you are creating a website in WordPress,

00:02:36.724 --> 00:02:41.939
WordPress will do the tagging for you through a few easy steps.
