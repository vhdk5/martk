00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.464
The all pages report displays many metrics.

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:10.199
But one metric that we don't see is conversion rate for goals or for e-commerce.

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.564
Similarly, if we were to access the top events report,

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:17.519
we would not see any conversion metrics.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.564
Of course, we would all want to know which pages and events are supporting conversions,

00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:27.470
but this correlation is not as obvious in Google Analytics as we may expect.

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:33.214
The reason goes back to the subtle but fundamental topic of scope in Google Analytics.

00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:38.125
Lets say that we have a series of pageviews and events that lead to a conversion,

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:42.439
when that conversion happens Google Analytics associates the conversion with

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:45.710
the entire session and everything that happened within

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.149
the session but not with individual hits within the session.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.179
Each hit within the session has hit scope.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.469
So, we can report metrics such as page views for pages,

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.310
and total events for events.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.420
But, we cannot directly report on conversion metrics for page views or for events.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.609
Again, because conversions exist at session scope,

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:13.780
and pageviews and events have hits scope.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.710
If we navigated to the landing pages report on the other hand,

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:21.729
we would see e-commerce conversion data,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.490
if of course e-commerce was configured,

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:26.839
and same thing for goals.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.480
Why do we see conversion data in

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.965
the landing pages report but not in the all pages report?

00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:38.045
The landing page is defined as the first page view in a session.

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:43.655
Therefore, the scope of the landing page dimension is not hit scope, but session scope.

00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:46.549
So, we can associate conversions with

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.849
landing pages being the first page view within a session,

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:52.024
session scope to session scope.

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:57.560
It's of course very very useful to be able to see conversion data landing pages.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.370
But we also want to know how pages and events are

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.185
supporting conversions when they're not the first hit in the session.

00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:10.170
That's what we're going to explore in this lesson.
