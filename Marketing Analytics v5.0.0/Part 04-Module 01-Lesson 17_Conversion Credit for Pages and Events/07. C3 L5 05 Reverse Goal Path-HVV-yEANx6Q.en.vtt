00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.325
Funnel Visualization and Goal Flow reports can be very useful but of course,

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:10.065
we need to configure the funnels to begin with in order to report on them.

00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:13.125
For instance, if we look at row eight of this report

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:17.115
reading basically from right to left in the report,

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:20.219
we see that in 290 instances,

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:25.439
the three steps leading to the goal destination were registersuccess.html,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.580
followed by store.html, followed by basket.html.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:36.935
The thing is, the 290 completions does not reflect abandonment.

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:41.195
We could have had great abandonment between step three and step two,

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:43.579
or step two and step one,

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.195
or step one and the goal completion location.

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:52.250
We can't know that unless we either do a manual analysis in

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.219
the pages report which we certainly could do

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.954
but it could also make sense to go ahead and set up a funnel.

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:03.799
So as you're considering funnel configuration for goals that you have already set up,

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.179
review the reverse goal path report for additional ideas for funnel configuration.
