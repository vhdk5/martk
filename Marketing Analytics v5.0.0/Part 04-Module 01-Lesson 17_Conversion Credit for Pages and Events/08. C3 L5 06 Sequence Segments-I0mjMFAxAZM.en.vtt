00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.134
So far in this lesson,

00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:06.099
we've explored how to determine if pages are helping conversions.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:11.349
But how do we know if other behaviors tracked as events are helping conversions?

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.695
Unfortunately, it's a little bit more difficult.

00:00:14.695 --> 00:00:20.109
For one thing, there's no equivalent of the page value metric for events,

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.625
and we can't use events as funnel steps in goal funnels.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:28.074
To determine if events are assisting conversions,

00:00:28.074 --> 00:00:32.905
we're going to take advantage of segments including sequence segments.

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:39.085
Sequence segments can be based on either page views or events or both.

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:45.929
Importantly, you can configure sequence segments at either session-scope or users-scope.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:51.005
So, we can see the effect of an event on conversions in a later session.

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.410
Also, unlike goals and goal funnels and

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.464
page value sequence segments and all segments are retroactive.

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:04.040
A drawback of course is that we would need to create a separate segment

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.825
for each event we're trying to analyze in terms of how it's helping conversions.

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:13.594
If we go back to the events examples that we saw in an earlier course,

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:18.364
one of the interactions that we would want to track as an event is Live Chat.

00:01:18.364 --> 00:01:22.524
We would want to know not only how often Live Chat is occurring,

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:25.440
but is Live Chat helping conversions?

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.914
Now, of course assuming that you have captured Live Chat as an event,

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:31.609
the process for determining

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.174
if Live Chat is helping conversions would consist of three steps.

00:01:36.174 --> 00:01:39.274
As the first step, we would want to create

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:43.010
a simple behavioral segment based on the Live Chat event,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.234
then we would want to create a sequence segment

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:49.944
based on the Live Chat event leading up to the conversion.

00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:53.059
Then we would want to apply both of the segments to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.870
the goal overview or e-commerce overview report.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.844
We would want to view a segmented report that looked something like this.

00:02:01.844 --> 00:02:05.150
Let's see how we would define the segments to apply to

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.575
this report and then we'll come back and look at some of the metrics more closely.

00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:14.599
To create a basic segment for all users who initiated

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.879
a Live Chat event we could just create

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.319
a basic segment based on event category and event action.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.280
Notice that we changed the scope from sessions to users.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.765
Of course, the benefit here is that we're going to be able to see the impact

00:02:29.764 --> 00:02:34.399
of an event in one session and conversions in potentially a later session.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.185
Another type of segment that we'll want to define will be the sequence segment,

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:44.104
where we're not only saying that we want to see users who started a Live Chat,

00:02:44.104 --> 00:02:47.939
but also those users who generated a transaction.

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.854
This sequence segment looks like the sequence segments that we saw in a previous lesson.

00:02:53.854 --> 00:02:59.769
Again, it's helping us to evaluate if an event is leading to conversions.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.689
As we saw previously we could also create

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.204
a sequence segment based on page views leading to conversions as well.

00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:11.975
With these two segments applied to the e-commerce overview report,

00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:14.090
we see to begin with,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.250
that the conversion rate is much higher for users who initiated a Live Chat,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.460
this is good, but we need to validate

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.465
if the Live Chat was occurring before the transactions.

00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:29.564
The sequence segment answers this question.

00:03:29.564 --> 00:03:36.215
We could see that of the revenue in Live Chat sessions most of that revenue

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:39.620
came when Live Chat occurred before

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.730
the e-commerce transaction and same thing for transaction count.

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:49.129
So, while it is a little bit harder NGA to determine to

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.859
support that events are providing to e-commerce transactions or to goal completions,

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.010
segments and specifically sequence segments,

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.204
help our analysis and they also provide

00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:06.320
a multi-session perspective that we can't get within the funnel reports.
