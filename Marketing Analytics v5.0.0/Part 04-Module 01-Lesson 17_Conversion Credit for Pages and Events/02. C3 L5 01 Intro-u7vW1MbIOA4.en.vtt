00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
In this lesson, we'll explore ways to

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:05.879
determine if pages and events are helping conversions.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.070
A critical question for everyone.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.205
We'll start off with a scope consideration.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:15.509
A big part of the challenge is that pages and events are hit-scope

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.655
dimensions and we're trying to compare them to session-scope conversion metrics.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:25.125
To address this challenge will look at the important page value metric.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:29.280
We'll also take a deep dive into the funnel reports and metrics.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.870
We'll also look at the reverse goal path report for additional insight

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:36.390
about the pages leading to goal conversions

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.325
and potential candidates for additional funnels.

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:42.800
We'll conclude with a discussion about sequence segments,

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:46.819
and how we can use them to determine the help that not only pages,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.744
but also events are providing to conversions

00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:53.739
within a single session or spanning multiple sessions.
