00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.469
The rightmost column in the all pages report is

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:10.529
the often overlooked but potentially very useful metric page value.

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:17.460
The page value metric is designed to indicate the amount of support that pages are

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.995
providing to goal and

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:25.365
e-commerce conversions that occur after the page view has occurred in the session.

00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:30.890
To illustrate page value let's look at lifecoach.com The data that we'll

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.770
see is for demo purposes only it's not real GA data from lifecoach.com.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.200
But the reason that we're referring to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.969
lifecoach.com for the page value discussion is that

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.579
there are at least two conversions on

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.394
lifecoach.com sign up today to sign up for a newsletter.

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:58.205
One example of coaching that we can purchase would be one-on-one coaching book here.

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:03.439
But you'll notice as with most other website experiences there are

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:10.204
many other pages that don't necessarily lead directly to conversion.

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:13.834
There's the blob. There are quizzes and tests.

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.324
There are many About pages.

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:23.120
These pages are not necessarily directly part of a conversion funnel but they are

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.495
designed to support conversion If only

00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:31.835
indirectly and that's exactly what page value is designed to surface.

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:35.959
The support that pages that are not directly

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.934
in the conversion funnel are still providing two conversions.

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:46.700
If a user accesses the what is a life coach page you want to know if this page is making

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.609
the user more likely to convert in order for

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.569
Google Analytics to be able to calculate page value,

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.069
there has to be at least one goal with goal value configured,

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.784
or e-commerce revenue or both to configure value for a goal.

00:02:03.784 --> 00:02:07.609
We can switch value on in the goal configuration.

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.289
For now we're going to add an arbitrary value of one US dollar.

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.299
So, let's say that we had

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.580
a one dollar goal value for the newsletter sign-up goal on lifecoach.com.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.000
Let's take a look at five sample sessions.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.925
Three of the sessions had a goal conversion.

00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:28.820
Now, how would Google Analytics calculate

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.509
page value relative to this one dollar goal conversion?

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:36.364
Here are five pages that we hope are supporting conversion.

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:39.594
We see that in the case of the press room page.

00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:41.870
There were three sessions in which the page

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.509
was viewed at least once before the conversion,

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.120
and five sessions total in which the page

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.375
was viewed with or without a conversion following.

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.365
If we go down the list,

00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:56.515
we see the goal value and the number of sessions for each of the pages.

00:02:56.514 --> 00:03:00.054
Then we could do the calculation of page value.

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:05.015
Of course, Google Analytics would do this for us behind the scenes.

00:03:05.014 --> 00:03:07.769
Sixty cents, seventy five cents,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.745
fifty cents, zero, and thirty three cents.

00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:16.990
So, we see that the success stories pages has the highest page value.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.995
This means that the success stories page is helping us.

00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:23.349
If a page is viewed and a conversion is

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.259
occurring frequently afterwards in the same session,

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.524
that page is helping us.

00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:30.314
If on the other hand,

00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:33.109
a page is viewed over and over and over again,

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.260
and a conversion is never happening in the same session,

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:39.215
that page is probably not helping us.

00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:42.050
That's why the page value metric is so helpful in

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.155
identifying pages that are helping convergence.

00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:49.009
As a note, the page value metric is not really designed to

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:53.524
evaluate pages that you already know are part of the conversion funnel.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:56.270
Page value is intended more to identify

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.750
those pages that are not directly in a conversion funnel,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.930
but still exist to support conversions.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.860
The paid value metric in relation to e-commerce revenue,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.860
works largely the same way as for goal value.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.605
The difference is page value for e-commerce is based on actual e-commerce revenue.

00:04:15.604 --> 00:04:20.480
So, when we're calculating page value based on e-commerce revenue,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.180
we're seeing the actual average revenue that

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.465
is accrued after a page is viewed in a session.

00:04:26.464 --> 00:04:31.449
Here we see the page that is contributing most to revenue per session.

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.579
Going back to goal value,

00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:38.269
it can sometimes be hard to decide how to specify the value of a goal.

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:40.969
Let's consider a few different approaches.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.500
If we have one goal on our site and that goal is to sell a t-shirt,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.319
and each t-shirt costs $15.

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.745
We can use the actual purchase price as the goal value.

00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:55.314
That's a straightforward scenario.

00:04:55.314 --> 00:04:57.339
If we have a lead submission,

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:01.644
and each closed lead is worth about $2,000 to us,

00:05:01.644 --> 00:05:05.454
and we know that we close 10 percent of the leads that are submitted,

00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:09.634
we could estimate the goal value to be $200.

00:05:09.634 --> 00:05:12.314
We could also use relative value.

00:05:12.314 --> 00:05:17.339
Meaning that if we have a contact us submission, and newsletter sign-up,

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.729
and we feel that the contact us submission is

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.595
five times as important as the newsletter sign-up,

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:25.530
we could assign a goal value of five dollars to

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:29.384
contact us and one dollar to the newsletter sign-up.

00:05:29.384 --> 00:05:32.569
Coming up, we'll also see how we could evaluate

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.064
page value for each of these goals independently.

00:05:36.064 --> 00:05:39.589
For goals that are hard to put a monetary value on,

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:45.500
it's still perfectly valid to assign an arbitrary value of one dollar or $100,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.475
or of course any currency that you are using.

00:05:48.475 --> 00:05:51.290
Because even an arbitrary value for a goal,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.535
will allow Google Analytics to calculate the page value metric.

00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:59.450
We do want to keep in mind that page value is based on

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.089
all e-commerce revenue and goal value that is recorded in the view.

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:07.549
This of course is not ideal if you want to

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.035
evaluate a page value for just one type of conversion.

00:06:12.035 --> 00:06:18.640
So, how could we evaluate page value for just e-commerce or a specific goal?

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.250
As one potential approach,

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.139
you could decide to just record revenue or

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.024
goal value for your most important conversion point.

00:06:28.024 --> 00:06:30.024
If you have e-commerce,

00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:33.634
you might decide not to configure goal value let's say for

00:06:33.634 --> 00:06:36.110
a newsletter sign-up and instead use

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.400
page value only in relation to the e-commerce transactions.

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:42.019
But then of course,

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:47.149
you would not be able to use page value relative to that other newsletter sign-up goal.

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:52.399
As another approach, you could create separate views per conversion type.

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:54.754
This would be very clean.

00:06:54.754 --> 00:06:57.829
You would just need to refer to the multiple views to

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:01.399
see the page value for different conversion types.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:05.149
A more dynamic approach would be to create segments

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:08.974
that excludes sessions with the other conversion types.

00:07:08.975 --> 00:07:16.040
For instance, here I've created a segment that excludes sessions in which there were

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.615
transactions and also exclude sessions in which goal one and goal three were completed.

00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:27.350
This means that we can evaluate page value just

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.760
four sessions in which goal two potentially took place.

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:35.944
A downside to this approach is that we would be excluding

00:07:35.944 --> 00:07:41.719
goal two in sessions where it also occurred with one of the other conversion types.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.290
But overall, this approach will allow us to use

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.189
page value in relation to goal two value and of

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:52.790
course we would only have to exclude the other goals if

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.600
there was a goal value associated with the goals to begin with.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.705
Now, with the segment applied to the pages report,

00:07:59.704 --> 00:08:05.050
we're able to see page value relative to goal two only.

00:08:05.829 --> 00:08:12.139
We also want to remember that page value has session scope not users scope,

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:14.259
this is a limitation.

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:18.539
This means that if I'm on lifecoach.com and I go to

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.924
the free quizzes page today and they sign up for coaching tomorrow,

00:08:23.923 --> 00:08:26.419
the free quizzes page would not earn

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.680
any page value for the conversion that took place the next day.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.360
So, we don't want to rule out a page that has a lower page value,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.164
especially for a more complex conversion.

00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:42.559
We'll want to use user scope sequence segments which we'll talk about coming

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:47.779
up to fully determine if a page is helping conversions in a later session.

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:51.799
So, certainly a higher page value is

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:55.659
an indicator that a page is helping conversions in the same session.

00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:58.504
But a page with a lower page value

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:02.120
may still be helping conversions in a following session.
