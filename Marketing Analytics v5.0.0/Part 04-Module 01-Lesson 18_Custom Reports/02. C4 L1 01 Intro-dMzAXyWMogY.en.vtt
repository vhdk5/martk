00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.314
This lesson, is all about Custom Reports.

00:00:03.314 --> 00:00:06.900
We'll see how to use custom reports to surface dimensions that don't

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.470
appear as primary dimensions in any of the built-in reports.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.480
Very importantly, we'll talk about using custom dimensions in custom reports.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.130
We'll also look at custom metrics and calculated metrics and custom reports.

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:22.634
We'll review different custom report formats,

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:25.920
including Flat Table and Map Overlay.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.970
We'll see how to hard-filter custom reports.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:32.429
As an overall theme,

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.310
we'll review customer reports as a means of

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.785
streamlined stakeholder focused communication.

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:41.704
You never have to use a built-in GA report

00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:44.600
when you could set up a more effective custom report.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.300
In this lesson, we'll see how.
