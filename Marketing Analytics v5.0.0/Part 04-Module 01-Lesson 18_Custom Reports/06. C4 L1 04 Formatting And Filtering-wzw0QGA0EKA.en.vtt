00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
All of the custom reports that we have created so

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.050
far have used the default explorer type.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.254
The Explorer format, looks like most of the built-in reports that we're used to seeing.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:14.130
In the explorer format,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.355
if we wanted to we could create dimension drill-downs.

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:20.265
For instance, we could select operating system,

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.740
and then drill-down to browser.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.339
But, if we wanted to display these dimension side-by-side,

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.664
we could use the flat table format.

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:32.399
Now, if we add some metrics, sessions,

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.765
average session duration, main again for the Report Tab name,

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:42.164
we'll call this report OS and Browser Flat,

00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:44.554
and now we could see the combinations of

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:49.085
operating system and browser laid out in the flat table format.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:51.740
We're back in the custom report that we defined

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.920
previously for e-commerce performance by country.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.660
This report is very useful, and very streamlined.

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.534
But, we may want to take advantage of the map overlay format

00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:05.765
for additional visual appeal, and effective communication.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:10.784
Click "Edit", and we'll switch over to map overlay as the report type.

00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:13.754
For zoom level, we'll keep that at world.

00:01:13.754 --> 00:01:16.795
For dimension, we'll select country,

00:01:16.795 --> 00:01:20.465
and now we have the same data plus the map overlay.

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:26.060
We're back in our Landing Pages Streamlined Custom Report that we defined previously.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.115
Let's filter for mobile only.

00:01:28.114 --> 00:01:30.199
At the bottom of every customer report,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.670
we have filters available.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.730
This is actually another important advantage of custom reports.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.730
We can build filters right in device category, exactly matches mobile.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.835
Notice that the other option is our friend rejects.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:50.659
So, if we wanted to filter for mobile and tablet we could pipe tablet in,

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.829
mobile pipe tablet, mobile or tablet.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.219
But for now, let's just filter for mobile,

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.519
and let's rename the report Landing Pages Streamlined-Mobile Only.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:08.525
Now, we have a nice streamlined report showing only the metrics that we want to show,

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:12.590
and with a built-in filter for a specific dimension value.
