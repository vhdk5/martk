00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.388
Now that you've had a closer look under the hood,

00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:07.429
you can see what an incredibly powerful tool Google Analytics is,

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.009
and how it can serve almost any of your reporting needs.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.730
You can derive insights that will help you improve your site,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.949
your marketing, and your business.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.910
But the vast possibilities and the massive amounts of data,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.280
can also become somewhat overwhelming.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.089
That's where custom reports and dashboards can help you.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.975
We will show you in this course how you can use them.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:32.490
Before we get started,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.295
it's a good idea for you to remember one of our earlier lessons about goals and KPIs.

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:41.355
It's good to list your goals and the metrics that will

00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:44.479
indicate whether you are successful in reaching them.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:50.269
Those will be the metrics that you want to monitor and report on on an ongoing basis.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.305
They will form the basis of the custom reports and dashboards,

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:55.820
you decide to build.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.679
As you will see, Google Analytics has a build in custom reporting option,

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.060
where you can build the reports you want to see and share on an ongoing basis.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.034
But Google also offers a separate tool, Google Data studio,

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:13.354
that lets you build dashboards or reports with your Google Analytics data.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:15.049
We will take a look at both,

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.219
but in this first lesson,

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.179
we'll focus on the build in Google Analytics custom reports.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.730
Let's get started.
