00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Custom reports are very useful and very straightforward once you know how to use them,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.380
but they are underutilized.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.769
Custom reports allow you to combine dimensions and

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.524
metrics in ways that don't always appear in the built-in reports.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:20.760
Very importantly, custom reports allow you to streamline your reporting.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.705
Often they're more useful for what they don't show.

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:29.579
Let's say you're managing the Google merchandise store or another retail property,

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.875
and your sales manager asks you,

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:34.274
"How are sales doing by country?"

00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:36.704
Your first reaction might be,

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:39.234
"I know which report I could show my manager."

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:42.649
I can go to geo-location and here are

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.489
the countries that appear as the primary dimension by default.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.795
If we scroll over,

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.344
we can see several e-commerce metrics.

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:54.144
But you actually have not done as good a job as you could do.

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:57.260
So, what you can do instead is go to

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:01.879
"Customisation," "Custom reports," click "New Custom Report."

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.094
Now, when you first open the Create Custom Report panel,

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:07.974
it can look a little bit busy.

00:01:07.974 --> 00:01:11.000
An important thing to remember is that you can define

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.519
a custom report with just one dimension and one metric,

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:18.804
and that's what we're going to focus on in the custom report.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:20.585
We'll start with our dimension.

00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:22.944
We're talking about countries.

00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:27.044
So, we'll just select "Country" as the primary dimension,

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.689
and then for metrics,

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.579
I always like to start with a baseline metric sessions or page views.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.454
We'll start with sessions here,

00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:39.375
then let's select "Ecommerce Conversion Rate,

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:42.599
Transactions, Revenue," and let's surface

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.074
another e-commerce metric that sometimes gets a little bit buried, average order value.

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:50.615
For metric group, we don't have to worry about the name of that too much,

00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:52.614
we can just call this e-commerce.

00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:55.099
Report tab, we also don't have to worry about

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.694
that too much unless we're adding several tabs.

00:01:57.694 --> 00:01:59.899
We'll just call this tab "Main,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.335
Custom Report Name," E-commerce by country is good.

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:04.944
Go ahead and click "Save."

00:02:04.944 --> 00:02:08.764
Now, we have a nice streamlined Ecommerce report by country.

00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:11.719
This will provide a better way for you to communicate

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.275
with your manager and answer the question that was asked of you.

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:17.450
Let's take another example.

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:22.609
Let's say that you have a colleague who specializes in page design and they ask you,

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.205
"How are my landing pages performing?"

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:28.730
They're aware of the concept of landing pages and they

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.500
want to understand the performance of the pages they have designed.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.210
Again, you may first want to navigate to

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.969
the landing pages report to show to your colleague,

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.460
but some of these metrics may be a distraction.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.670
You may not want to focus as much on pages per

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:47.854
session as on bounce rate and Ecommerce conversion rate.

00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:49.489
Again in this case,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.015
you can go to "Customisation," "Custom report"

00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:57.004
and quickly put together a more streamlined and effective report.

00:02:57.004 --> 00:03:01.954
"Add dimension, Landing Page for metrics sessions,

00:03:01.955 --> 00:03:06.575
Bounce Rate, Average Session Duration, Ecommerce Conversion Rate."

00:03:06.574 --> 00:03:10.129
We can add whichever metrics we think are important and leave out

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.000
the metrics that we think are not especially relevant to the conversation.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.724
Metric Group perfomance, we can call it whatever we want, "Report Tab," "Main."

00:03:20.724 --> 00:03:24.838
Let's call this report "Landing Pages Streamlined."

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:27.590
Here again, we have a much more effective report

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.560
to respond to the question that was asked.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.224
As a few more considerations regarding custom reports,

00:03:34.224 --> 00:03:39.544
you only need read and analyze access two of you to create a custom report.

00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:41.929
You do not need edit rights.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.069
Custom reports don't alter any underlying report data.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.604
They're retroactive and they're yours only unless you decide to share them.

00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:53.750
Note that by default,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.435
customer reports are accessible only by you within the view that you've created them in.

00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:03.740
If we click into "Landing Pages Streamlined," and we click "Edit," we

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.555
can see that the custom report is accessible only within this view.

00:04:08.555 --> 00:04:11.629
If we did want to make the custom report accessible to

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.185
all views within this account under our login,

00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:17.045
we could change the visibility setting.

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:19.790
Also note that if we wanted to share the configuration

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.045
for any custom report with another Google Analytics user,

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:24.640
we can click "Actions,

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.610
Share," share template link and forward this URL to that other user.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.710
We'll talk more about sharing in an upcoming lesson.
