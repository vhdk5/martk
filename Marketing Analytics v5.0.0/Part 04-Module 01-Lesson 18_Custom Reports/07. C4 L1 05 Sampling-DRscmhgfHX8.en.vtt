00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
We're back in the Landing Pages Streamlined - Mobile Only custom report,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.359
and you may notice a yellow shield appearing at the top of the report.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.399
If we hover over the yellow shield,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.204
we see the message that this report is based on 43.79 percent of sessions.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:20.004
This means that sampling has kicked in.

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:24.589
There are two factors that together cause sampling in Google Analytics.

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:30.454
One is that the time period you've selected has to include more than 500,000 sessions.

00:00:30.454 --> 00:00:32.464
In the paid version of GA,

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:35.150
the threshold for sampling is much higher,

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.674
100 million sessions, and you can export unsampled data if sampling does occur in the UI.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.564
But in the free version of GA,

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:47.119
sampling can kick in with 500,000 sessions or more.

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:51.019
The other factor that causes sampling is when you use a feature

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.160
that requires Google Analytics to do on-the-fly calculation.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.964
This could be secondary dimensions,

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:02.030
or segments, or some custom reports.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.730
If we navigate for instance to

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.995
the Mobile Overview report and we add our Australia and New Zealand segment,

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:15.280
we can see that the same sampling rate has kicked in 43.79 percent.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.588
If we go to Mobile Devices,

00:01:17.588 --> 00:01:19.879
we still see the same level of sampling.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.739
How does sampling work in this report?

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:24.559
For right now, let's remove the all user segment.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.400
Let's consider the Google Pixel 2 XL,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.500
and have sampling might affect how it's reported.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.644
If we apply the Australia and New Zealand segment to our Mobile Devices report,

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:38.569
this report may not show an accurate number of

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.409
pixel 2 XL sessions from Australia and New Zealand.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.295
Let's say that in reality,

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:48.094
there were 10,000 of these sessions in the time period selected.

00:01:48.094 --> 00:01:52.158
The challenge is that Google Analytics hasn't already calculated

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.600
metrics for every combination of mobile device and country.

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.119
By applying a segment to the report,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.775
you're forcing on-the-fly calculation.

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:06.665
So again, when that 500,000 session threshold is exceeded,

00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:09.205
and you add a segment to a report,

00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:14.300
GA applies that segment only to a portion of the underlying view data,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.300
and then it multiplies the resulting metrics back out to the 100 percent proportion.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.380
In this way, GA can save processing time and deliver the result in report more quickly.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.574
I don't want to suggest that the sampling would always affect accuracy to this extent.

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:37.849
But let's further consider when sampling could have the greatest impact.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.055
When we're discussing sampling,

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:43.775
we need to consider the concept of cardinality.

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:48.980
Cardinality means the number of individual values for a single dimension,

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.594
which manifests as the number of rows in a report.

00:02:52.594 --> 00:02:57.455
We want to be cautious of sampling in high cardinality reports.

00:02:57.455 --> 00:03:02.960
That means when we're in a reports such as mobile devices and sampling has been applied,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.094
because there are 242 rows in this report relatively high cardinality,

00:03:09.094 --> 00:03:11.854
sampling is more likely to skew the data.

00:03:11.854 --> 00:03:16.039
Now the sample size we're dealing with is 43.79 percent,

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:17.900
so almost half of the data.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.280
So, the skewing probably still isn't too bad.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.930
Where you want to be really careful is where you have

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.900
high cardinality and a very low sample rate,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.284
then your data is likely to be very skewed.

00:03:29.284 --> 00:03:31.224
Back in this report,

00:03:31.224 --> 00:03:33.710
we see that there are only three rows,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.409
this is a very low cardinality report.

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:41.750
With a low cardinality report and a relatively high sampling rate 44 percent.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.534
In this case, we don't have to worry too much about sampling.

00:03:45.534 --> 00:03:48.560
The breakdown of desktop mobile and tablet

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.354
for Australia and New Zealand is still probably fairly accurate,

00:03:52.354 --> 00:03:57.799
again, because the sample rate is relatively high and the cardinality is very low.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.960
If we want to unsampled sampled data,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.120
a couple of options could be to export shorter time periods.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.855
If the multiple time periods you select contain fewer than 500,000 sessions,

00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:16.029
you could export reports from GA and reassemble them in another environment,

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:20.409
thereby reproducing unsampled data for a longer time period.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.215
We will be talking more about exporting in the next lesson.

00:04:24.214 --> 00:04:27.560
You can also use a specialized tool to retrieve

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.879
unsampled data that would otherwise be sampled in the GA UI.

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.449
Analytics Canvas is a third party tool that

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.979
in particular meets this need very effectively.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.370
Most importantly, stay aware of sampling when you're using

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.500
custom reports and applying secondary dimensions or segments to your report.
