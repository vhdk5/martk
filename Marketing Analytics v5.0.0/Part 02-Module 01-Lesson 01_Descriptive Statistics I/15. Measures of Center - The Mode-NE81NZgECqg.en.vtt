00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
The third measure of center,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.135
aims at providing us the most common value in the data set.

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:07.720
In this data set,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.580
this is the value of three.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.185
The value that occurs most often is known as the Mode.

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:16.940
These are all three potential measures of center.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.580
The Mean or the average,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.155
the Median or the middle value,

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.820
and the Mode or the most frequent value.
