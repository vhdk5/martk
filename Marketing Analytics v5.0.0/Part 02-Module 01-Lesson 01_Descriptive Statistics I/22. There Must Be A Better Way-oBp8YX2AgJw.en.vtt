00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.005
In the next concepts,

00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:07.545
we are going to combine what we know about how to calculate the mean with notation.

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:11.700
The purpose of this video is not to relearn how to calculate the mean

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.115
but rather to introduce notation using a measure you already know.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:21.710
Let's consider the amount of time someone spends on our website in minutes.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.220
Imagine we collect the amount of time spent on our site for five individuals.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.900
From the last video,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.905
we saw that we could label the values in this way,

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.140
x1 for the first value,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.210
x2 for the second value,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.660
x3 for the third value and so on.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.030
Imagine we want to add the first two numbers together.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.970
We could write this in notation as x1 plus x2 which in this example,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.160
would be the same as 15 plus 10.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.230
If we wanted to add more than just two values,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.920
it would be tedious to continue the same process.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.469
Imagine if we had 100 values.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.239
We would have a, x1 plus x2 plus x3

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.545
plus and we'd have to continue this process until x 100.

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:14.150
Someone must have come up with a better way to notate this.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.690
And it turns out, there is a better way.
