00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.650
When analyzing both discrete and continuous quantitative data,

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.994
we generally discuss four main aspects.

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:11.485
The center, the spread,

00:00:11.485 --> 00:00:14.200
the shape and outliers.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.220
In this lesson, we will focus on measures of center.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.485
There are three widely accepted measures of center.

00:00:21.485 --> 00:00:24.935
The mean, the median and the mode.

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:28.225
To illustrate how each of these measures is calculated,

00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:32.829
consider this table of the number of dogs I see at the coffee shop in a week.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.030
From the table, we can see that on Monday, I saw five dogs.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.475
On Tuesday, I saw three dogs.

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:43.350
On Wednesday, I saw eight dogs and so on.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.695
A friend might ask you,

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:48.375
how many dogs would you expect to see on any given day?

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:51.980
We might choose to respond to this in a lot of different ways.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.890
Like, it depends on the day or it depends on the week.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.750
But commonly, the word expect is associated with the mean or the average of our data set.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.720
The mean is calculated as the sum of all of

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.100
the values in our data set divided by how many data points we have.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.590
As you can see calculated here,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.590
this value is 12.57 dogs.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.350
That is, the sum of the number of dogs observed on

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.970
each day divided by the number of days in a week.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.610
The mean isn't always the best measure of center.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.325
For this data set,

00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:32.385
you can see that the mean doesn't really seem like it's in the middle of the data at all.

00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:39.020
There are only two of the seven days that have recorded more dogs than the reported mean.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.720
It also is splitting our dogs into

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.690
decimal values which will seem strange when we're reporting back to our friend.
