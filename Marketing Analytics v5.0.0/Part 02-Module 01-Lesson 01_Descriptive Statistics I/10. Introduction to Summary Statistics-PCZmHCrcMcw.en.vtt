00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
In the next lessons,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.160
we will discuss how to use statistics to describe quantitative data.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.040
You will gain insight into a process of how data is

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.200
collected and how to answer questions using your data.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.080
Throughout this lesson, I hope you learn to be critical of

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.980
your analysis that happened under the hood and what the numbers actually mean.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.465
As an example of an analysis that we do here at Udacity,

00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:31.765
we look at how long a nanodegree program takes students to complete.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:37.265
We try to provide an estimate of the number of months or hours that students will spend.

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:40.010
One way we might start is by reporting

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.030
the average amount of time it takes to complete the nanodegree program.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.470
But that doesn't tell the whole story.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.055
I'm sure there are differences in completion

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:53.150
depending on what students knew before entering the program.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.960
The shortest amount of time needed to complete

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.485
the nanodegree program might just be a few weeks.

00:00:58.485 --> 00:01:01.715
How did those people complete the course so fast?

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:05.580
Well, the longest might be a couple of years.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.285
What proportion of students finish fast within two months?

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:12.210
What proportion take longer than eight months?

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.935
Using a variety of measures,

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:15.465
like measures of center,

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:18.510
give you an idea of the average student.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.220
Measures of spread give you an idea of how students differ.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.045
Visuals can provide us

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:30.690
a more complete picture of how long it takes any student to complete a program.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.790
The material in the next sections will show you how to use

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.730
these measures in a way that is informative and understandable to others.
