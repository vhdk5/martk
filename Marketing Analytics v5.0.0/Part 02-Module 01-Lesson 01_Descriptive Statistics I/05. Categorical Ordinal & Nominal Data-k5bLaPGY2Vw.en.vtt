00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
We can divide categorical data types further into

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.125
categorical ordinal and categorical nominal.

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:09.870
First, let's look at categorical ordinal data.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.955
Remember those dogs at the coffee shop?

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:15.550
Let's say I give each a rating of how nice it is to me.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.590
Sometimes I shake hands with the dog and we become best friends.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.075
Other times, it pees on my shoe.

00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:25.935
I rate these interactions from very positive to very negative.

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:31.000
These ranked categories are known as categorical ordinal data.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.255
Notice, this is different than the breeds,

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.120
which are known as categorical nominal data,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.120
and do not have a rank order.
