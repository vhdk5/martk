00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.674
I want to focus on evaluating your market share.

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:06.929
Your market share is an important metric to determining

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:10.410
how your business is doing relative to your competition.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.850
This provides a good indication of where you have opportunity and it also

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.244
provides an excellent way to monitor your growth within that target market.

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:23.210
A market size analytics is also used to determine how big

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.315
the market is for your products and services and whether there is any growth potential.

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:33.590
Now, the size of a market is typically measured in volume or value.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.900
For example, if 100 widgets are sold worldwide and we know that we sold 10 of them,

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.265
then we can say that we have 10 percent of the market share.

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:51.140
Alternatively, if we know that 100 widgets are sold worldwide for $10 each,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.045
then we can say the current value of this market is $1,000.

00:00:55.045 --> 00:00:58.020
If we sold $100 of those widgets,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.730
then we could also arrive at our 10 percent market share.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.864
Now, market definitions are not trivial.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.655
You can compare markets by geographic areas,

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:11.715
customer segments, sales channels, and so on.

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:14.379
If you see your market to broadly,

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:16.984
you might fail because you have no focus.

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:18.545
If you see it too narrow,

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:22.415
you might miss opportunities and allow competitors to creep in.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:26.940
Let's look at the various ways that we can calculate market share.
