00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
We've talked a lot about measuring all of

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:04.960
the various channels that you're using in your marketing,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.685
but we've glossed over the importance of comparing channels to one another.

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.345
Now there are hundreds of possible channels to market your products.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.660
So it's important that we evaluate which channels perform the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.250
best relative to one another within our target customer segment.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.179
Marketing channel analytics looks at costs and return on

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.289
investment so that the marketing budget can be used more effectively.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.724
We use channel analytics to answer several questions,

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:36.225
such as, what type of marketing is most cost effective for us?

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:41.325
What channel yields the best result or yields the most profit?

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:46.670
The big trap to avoid here is not assessing each channel on its own,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.460
because it's rare that one channel will get all of the credit.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.225
Remember, the customer's moving through that complex journey.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:56.840
So we have to be delicate with how we handle this analysis.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.530
Let's look at a few ways that we can compare our channel analytics.
