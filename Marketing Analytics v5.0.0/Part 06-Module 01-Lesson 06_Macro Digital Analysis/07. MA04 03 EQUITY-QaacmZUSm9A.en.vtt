00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.455
There are several methods for determining if your brand is successful.

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:10.500
The one I find to be most approachable is called The Brand Asset Valuator model.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.754
The marketing communications agency Young &amp; Rubicam

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:17.565
developed this model in the mid 90s and it's still relevant today.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:22.859
The idea is, that your company's brand health and future can be evaluated by

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.394
collecting consumer insight in four key areas: differentiation,

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:32.820
relevance, esteem, and knowledge.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.060
Typically, you'll capture these insights through

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.745
the form of surveys or customer interviews.

00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:42.634
In fact, if you do a Google search for a survey monkey BAV,

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:47.750
you'll find already built surveys that you can use to immediately conduct this research.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.929
Let's explore these four key areas in more depth.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.500
With differentiation, you'll measure by asking

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.310
questions about how often consumers have encountered your brand,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.929
if they recognize it,

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.990
and what makes it different from your competition.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.900
With relevance, it's important to measure whether or

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.855
not a consumer would purchase your product or service.

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:11.240
Does it fit their perceptions on price,

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:14.149
convenience, and how it fits into their lifestyle?

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.755
You can ask simple questions,

00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:18.119
such as the likelihood that they would buy from you,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.844
or whether they've purchased what you're selling in the past.

00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:25.069
As we get into esteem, it can get a little fuzzier.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.649
Here you're capturing what a consumer feels.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.460
You'll ask questions about your brand, reputation, and personality.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.184
How different are you? How reliable,

00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:36.780
helpful, or regarded is your brand?

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.855
Finally, we have knowledge.

00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:41.915
This is where you assess what a consumer knows about your brand.

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:44.180
Can they name your product and services?

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.490
Do they know who your competition is?

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:49.114
What did they think your product or service does?

00:01:49.114 --> 00:01:50.644
The less they know,

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:52.609
the lower your brand equity.

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.950
According to the BAV model,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.234
you'll then measure how these areas relate to one another.

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:01.299
You'll find that certain areas are higher than others.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.405
When differentiation outranks relevance,

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:08.659
then there's a natural curiosity present in the mind of your consumer.

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.354
They want to learn more,

00:02:10.354 --> 00:02:13.144
but you need a way to determine if your relevant.

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:15.050
If the opposite is true,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.585
relevance is higher than differentiation,

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:20.510
then you are being grouped together with your competitor.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:24.199
It's likely that consumers aren't seeing a perceived benefit.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.919
Instead, they're making a purchase based on convenience.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.049
When we look at the remaining areas,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.380
you may find that your esteem is higher than knowledge.

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.419
Here, your customers desire of your brand is that they want to purchase

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:43.589
because they see this esteem and loyalty and they want to experience it firsthand.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.170
If knowledge is higher than esteem,

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:50.329
then customers don't feel like they need to learn anything more about you.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.850
There's no longer any suspense or interests

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.349
generated by your brand and their judgment has been made.

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.479
You can generally identify how your brand ranks in

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:04.759
these various areas by simply asking key questions and reviewing the data on your own.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.729
You'll notice patterns and should be able to pinpoint

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.164
what areas of your equity measurement outperform others.

00:03:11.164 --> 00:03:13.759
Explore the ways to measure your brand equity.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.459
This is meaningful even for a small company,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.740
and it can be handled even outside of

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.010
a survey by simply having a conversation with your customers.
