00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.035
Net Promoter Score is a measurement of customer loyalty.

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:07.349
A company's Net Promoter Score or NPS for short,

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:11.445
is measured in a survey that asks one simple question,

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:17.620
"How likely is it that you would recommend our company to a friend or colleague?"

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.620
Following the question is a consistent scale with a range

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.208
from 0-10,0 being not an unlikely,

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:28.969
5 being neutral, and 10 being extremely likely.

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:33.409
This simple question provides fantastic insight into customer loyalty,

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:37.640
and eliminates long and complicated surveys that most people ignore.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.585
Now this idea was introduced by Fred Reichheld in 2003,

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:43.820
through a Harvard Business Review article.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.579
Reichheld invested two years into research,

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.064
linking survey responses with actual customer behavior,

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:53.074
and the results revealed the true value of NPS.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:55.880
This one question about a customer's willingness to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.554
recommend your product or service reveals their true loyalty.

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:01.850
Based on the score a customer indicates,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.204
they fall into one of three groups: promoter, passive, or detractor.

00:01:08.204 --> 00:01:10.894
A promoter would score 9 or 10.

00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:12.519
There are huge fans of the product of

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:15.864
the service and they go out of their way to advocate for it.

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:18.804
Promoters put their own reputation on the line.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:22.450
A responsive 7 or 8 makes that customer passive.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.344
This person probably liked what you had to offer,

00:01:25.344 --> 00:01:27.069
but there was no wow factor.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.789
They may have had a few issues or didn't see much value over the competition.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.900
A passive customer isn't likely to steer others away from your company,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.865
but they're not going to recommend it,

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:42.199
and finally anyone answering with a score of 6 or below, becomes a detractor,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.900
and a detractor will take any chance they can get to

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.855
push people away from your product or service.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:50.930
Detractors are often more vocal than promoters,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.965
because their level of dissatisfaction is incredibly high.

00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:58.859
The ratings are then used to develop one numerical score,

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.239
and this metric allows companies to quantify how

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:06.619
changes to a product or service impact the customer experience over time.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.844
Now, a score of greater than 50 is pretty good.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:13.099
But you can do some research on NPS by brand or

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.594
industry and see how it pans out in your specific market.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.498
The biggest takeaway here,

00:02:18.498 --> 00:02:20.719
is that you need to be working to measure this to

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.955
identify if you're securing loyal customers.

00:02:23.955 --> 00:02:27.310
Customer loyalty is one of the most important drivers of growth,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.090
so take some time to consider the advantage of evaluating your NPS.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.710
You can start by surveying

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.330
a statistically valid sample of

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.770
your customers with that question we talked about earlier,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.145
"How likely is it that you would recommend our company to a friend or colleague?"

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:44.719
Introduce that scale from 0-10,

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.020
along with the key for what those values correspond to,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.550
and then collect the results.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.735
It's really important that you resist the urge to add any additional survey questions.

00:02:53.735 --> 00:02:57.410
You only need that one question to determine their status.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.914
From there, you calculate your score.

00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:03.289
You take the percentage of customers who responded with nine or

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:07.965
10 and subtract the percentage who respond with 0 through 6.

00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:11.015
In other words, subtract the percentage of detractors

00:03:11.014 --> 00:03:15.125
from the percentage of promoters to arrive at your Net Promoter Score.

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:18.349
Don't be surprised if the score is lower than you might expect.

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.965
The median Net Promoter Score of more than 400 companies

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:24.890
across 28 industries was just 16.

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.254
You might also consider measuring your Net Promoter Score across specific regions,

00:03:29.254 --> 00:03:31.715
products, or your customer segments.

00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:35.990
But what really counts is how your company compares with direct competitors.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.594
Now, there's a lot of online resources that you can use to survey these customers.

00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:44.794
Just run a Google search for NPS survey tools and evaluate the options,

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:47.609
to see what fits your needs.
