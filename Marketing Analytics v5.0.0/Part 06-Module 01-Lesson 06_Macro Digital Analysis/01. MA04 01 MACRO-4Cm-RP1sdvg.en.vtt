00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
In the last lesson,

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.160
we invested a lot of time looking at the micro analytics,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.200
very specific pieces of data with

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.415
a narrow focus that we had to combine together to tell a larger narrative.

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:17.265
Now, we pulled this data to primarily influence campaigns or objectives that we had set.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:21.250
We reported on this data to drive action in a organization.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.495
Another aspect of marketing analytics is data at a much larger level or macro analytics.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:30.165
In this lesson, we're going to look at how we study

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:33.570
large questions such as: What is the size of our market?

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.430
What are the current trends?

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.530
How is our competition performing?

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.540
How do we forecast growth?

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.745
How are our channels performing?

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:43.905
What is our net promoter score?

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:46.550
These large questions involve gathering

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.585
qualitative and quantitative data from a variety of sources,

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:54.325
and then applying your analytical skill sets to find these answers.

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:55.880
Through our time together,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.750
we'll discuss the concept and then we'll go hands-on as we explore where to find

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.220
the information we need and run the calculations necessary to answer these questions.
