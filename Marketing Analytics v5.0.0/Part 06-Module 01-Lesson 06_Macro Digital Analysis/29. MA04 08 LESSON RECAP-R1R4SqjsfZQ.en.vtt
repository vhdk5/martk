In this lesson, we looked at the marketing analytics

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:06.254
that apply at a much larger or macro level.

00:00:06.254 --> 00:00:09.974
We looked at how to evaluate our market size, our market trends,

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:11.699
run a competitor analysis,

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.359
and we even looked at how we measure and compare our marketing channels.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.859
We also saw the importance of measuring our net promoter score.

Now I know it feels like a lot but we've really only scratched the surface.

skills and the knowledge on how to apply them.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:37.399
From here, you'll be familiar enough to approach

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.820

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.340
