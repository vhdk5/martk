00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.769
Market trend analytics is all about figuring out if a market is growing,

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:06.794
stagnant, or in decline.

00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:11.250
It's also used to help us understand how fast that change is occurring.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.740
Now understanding market size is important,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.794
but knowing whether that market is in

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:19.515
a positive trend or a negative trend is just as important.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:21.208
If you know for example,

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:22.859
that your market is in decline,

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.314
then you might need to take action.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:27.270
You can choose to pivot your business into a new market,

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.314
or you can try and reinvigorate that market.

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:36.030
You may also decide to launch a new product or new initiatives into entirely new markets.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.730
Now, if you know that your market is growing,

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:41.779
then you can move resources into this market or invest in

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.245
campaigns that capitalize on that positive change.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:48.229
You should be looking at your market trend every six months,

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.339
just to get a good sense of how things are shifting and how your business fits in.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.330
With that, you'll be able to answer questions.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.489
Such as is this market growing, or is it declining?

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.865
Are there new markets we should be focusing on?

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:04.750
Are there markets we should abandon?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.015
Now, change in any market is inevitable.

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:11.299
The trick is knowing what those changes might be before they

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.689
arrive so you can stay ahead of them or adapt to meet them,

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.355
so you're staying competitive.

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:20.430
Let's look at how we can measure and monitor market trends together.
