00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
Competitor analytics is important for your marketing objectives.

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:06.314
It helps you understand your competition,

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:08.669
so you can decipher how they're positioned and

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.414
where they may have an advantage or disadvantage.

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:14.984
Competitor analytics pulls all the relevant information

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:16.919
on all of your competitors together

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.440
so you can see the whole picture not just

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.679
snapshots when you focus on one main competitor.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.835
Now, this is important because you don't exist in this market alone.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:28.484
There is always a competitor.

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:30.329
It might not be a direct competitor,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.979
but somebody is competing for

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.810
the same consumer's attention or trying to take money out of their wallet before you can.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.240
When we run a competitive analysis,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.969
we look at how our competitors are behaving and we also figure out why they might be

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.310
doing something in response to things

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.039
that we change on those campaigns that we're running.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.284
We have to predict what's going to happen with some sense of confidence.

00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:57.844
With competitor analytics, we seek to answer a few questions.

00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:00.769
Who are our key competitors?

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.615
What are their objectives?

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:05.365
What are their strengths and weaknesses?

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:07.649
What are their threats?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.875
What strategies might they be pursuing?

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:17.079
What does their revenue come from and what audience overall do we share?

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.064
Every marketer should be running a competitive analysis.

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:24.780
Let's look at how we can evaluate our competitors together.
