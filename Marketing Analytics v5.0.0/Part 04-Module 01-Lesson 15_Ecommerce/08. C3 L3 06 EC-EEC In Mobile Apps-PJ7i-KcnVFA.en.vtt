00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
You can also track e-commerce actions and data for your mobile apps.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.945
You can track this by using the Android SDK,

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:12.480
iOS SDK and also for a Firebase SDK +GTM implementation.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.445
In fact, one of the reasons that we would opt to use Firebase SDK+ GTM,

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:20.144
rather than the Firebase SDK on its own,

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:21.929
is that Firebase Analytics,

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.019
does not support enhanced e-commerce reporting per se.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.975
With Firebase SDK+ GTM,

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:29.970
we can enjoy the app lifecycle and

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.269
basic e-commerce event tracking that Firebase provides,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.650
and still take advantage of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.619
rich enhanced e-commerce reporting in the Google Analytics UI.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:42.814
You do want to consult the developer references for mobile e-commerce tracking.

00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:44.509
Just on the Firebase end,

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:48.394
Google recommends tracking the following retail commerce related events,

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:50.465
using the log event method.

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:52.430
We have add payment info,

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.950
add to cart, add to wishlist, begin checkout,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.755
e-commerce purchase, generate a lead,

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:01.465
purchase refund, view item list,

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:03.320
and view search results.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.719
I would definitely consult the Developer Guide in

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.045
terms of passing that information appropriately.

00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:12.670
Keep in mind that those events can be captured as variables within the GTM environment,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.450
and used as triggers and as dimensions and metrics,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.960
to send that e-commerce data to GA simultaneously.
