00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
Shopping and checkout behavior funnels allow you to identify drop-off points in

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.935
the overall shopping process and also within specific checkout steps.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:11.609
These funnels also allow you to create segments and to remarket to

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:15.599
users based on where they progress through the shopping flow or fall out.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.739
Let's use shopping behavior funnel as an example to look at how easily you can

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.359
create a segment that you can then also use to create a remarketing audience.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.259
Here we are in the Shopping Behavior Analysis report in the e-commerce section of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.045
GA. You can see there are some really powerful funnel steps that are visualized here.

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:35.370
For example, cart abandonment.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:41.304
These are people who added items to their cart but never made it to the checkout process.

00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:47.969
We can simply click here on cart abandonment and create a new segment.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.390
Once we do that, we can apply that segment to

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.840
our other reporting in GA. Like other segments,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.990
it will persist until removed,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:03.050
as in this audience overview report now with cart abandoner segment applied.

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.409
Once you have a segment applied to a report in Google Analytics,

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.854
it's a simple matter to click the down arrow and build an audience of that segment.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:15.799
As long as you have linked products such as

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.479
Google ads or displayed video 360 formerly double-click bid manager,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.709
where you can share retargeting audiences,

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:25.900
it really is simple.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.750
If you want to dynamically remarket your users with

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.549
product-specific ads based on the items they viewed and/or abandon in their cards,

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.689
be sure to reference Eric's lesson on dynamic remarketing in course two.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.319
When I click, it's going to bring me to the audience builder,

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.234
and it's going to populate the segment data into the audience tool.

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:48.819
I can configure the membership duration,

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.364
which I want to set at about two weeks.

00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:54.024
So, I'll add 14 days here.

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:56.210
I need to give the audience a name.

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.414
We'll call cart abandoners.

00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:00.530
We'll hit Next step,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.109
and then I have to select the destination.

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.563
I'm going to share it with an AdWords account

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:11.504
for using Google Display Network retargeting,

00:02:11.504 --> 00:02:19.759
and then I can publish this audience and use it for remarketing. Powerful stuff.
