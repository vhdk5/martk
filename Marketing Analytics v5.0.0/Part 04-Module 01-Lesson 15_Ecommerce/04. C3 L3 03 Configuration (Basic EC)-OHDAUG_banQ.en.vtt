00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
Let's discuss the configuration for basic e-commerce tracking.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.564
First, you must turn on e-commerce reporting in your GA property at the view level.

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:13.140
For the basic e-commerce configuration using GTM you need to configure

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.589
your Universal Analytics tag settings properly and make sure

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.280
that e-commerce reporting is turned on in at least one view in your property.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.210
Create a transaction tag type and set the fields to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.205
capture and send required data later variables for your e-commerce data when present.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:31.993
You can follow the developer reference documents

00:00:31.993 --> 00:00:34.424
specifically for basic e-commerce tracking.

00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:36.015
Just keep in mind though,

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:40.320
a required field for e-commerce tracking is going to be a transaction ID,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.215
and for product information is going to be either a product ID or product name.

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:48.440
Other than transaction ID and product ID,

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:50.539
the other fields are going to be optional,

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.079
the recommended if available.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.829
With the GTM implementation,

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.210
you're going to need to update your confirmation page code to output

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.770
some data layer data with the transaction and order information.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.230
Work with your developer to set these data layer variables.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.150
Here, I've highlighted the transaction information in

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.885
pink and again the required field is transaction ID.

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:18.020
If you have a transaction affiliation that is a store,

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:21.170
the transaction total, the transaction tax,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.070
shipping, and then the individual product level data including skew,

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.854
name, category, price, and quantity.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:34.880
Again, skew or a product name or product ID is a required field.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:38.780
To reiterate, most of these data points are not required,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.269
but if you have all of these pieces of data available,

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:43.899
we recommend that you should pass all of them in.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.955
As discussed in course one,

00:01:45.954 --> 00:01:49.549
product scope custom dimensions provide the opportunity to pass

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.245
any additional product descriptors such as color, size or model.

00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:57.170
It will give you and reporting more data, and of course,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.900
if you want product level revenue you're going to want to include the price.
