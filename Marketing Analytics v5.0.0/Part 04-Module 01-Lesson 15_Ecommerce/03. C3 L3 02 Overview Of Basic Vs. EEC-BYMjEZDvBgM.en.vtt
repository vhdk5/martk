00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.394
Let's have a brief overview of basic compared to enhanced ecommerce tracking.

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:06.660
Basic ecommerce tracking allows you to track

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.660
transaction and product information including: revenue,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.574
quantity, tax, shipping, product ID,

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:16.244
product name and basic category information.

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:21.120
This gives you good insights into your revenue generation transactions on your website.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.960
Then can be coupled with your acquisition data as

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.885
well as other standard Google Analytics reporting data.

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:29.660
Enhanced ecommerce tracking allows you to see all of

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.130
the basic ecommerce data along with additional insights into how promotions

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.160
and product lists as well as more detailed categories and

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:41.479
additional ecommerce actions such as Add to Cart or move from Cart,

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:45.379
checkout funnel steps, product reviews and product clicks and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.475
how these lead to the actual transaction and revenue that you see as well.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:52.895
You can configure both basic and enhanced ecommerce tracking

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:54.620
using your Tag Management System.

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:56.689
For example, GTM or via

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:00.364
inline tracking code if you still happen to be coding your analytics inline.

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:03.594
Let's take a brief look at the ecommerce reporting.

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:06.939
So, I've clicked into the conversions navigation tab on

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.884
the left hand navigation and then the ecommerce drop-down and overview.

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:15.640
Right away, I can see summary data charted by day.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.195
I can also see some high-level overview metrics such as revenue,

00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:21.339
conversion rate, transaction counts,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.055
average order value on my website.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:26.490
This will be basic ecommerce data and

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:29.140
a basic ecommerce implementation will give you that data.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.260
I can also see some additional data that's being driven by

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.545
the fact that this is an enhanced ecommerce implementation.

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:38.515
I see internal promotion performance.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:44.650
I also see order coupons and I see that I have enhanced ecommerce product categories.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.160
I can also see some additional basic ecommerce data such as products,

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.429
names and I can see product revenue by product name under the overview report.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.490
This is a nice single view report that is

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.774
standard in Google Analytics when you're using ecommerce tracking.

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:06.319
Again, depending on whether you're using basic or enhanced ecommerce,

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.469
you'll see more or less data here.

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.344
So, all of this data can be drilled down in

00:02:11.344 --> 00:02:16.370
greater detail in the expanded ecommerce reports.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.509
It does rely on passing this data into GA with relevant hits.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.149
So, let's take a look at how you actually configure

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.900
this data to get into GA when it's relevant.
