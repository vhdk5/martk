00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.955
For enhanced Ecommerce implementation,

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:06.884
you have to follow some of the same steps for basic E-commerce.

00:00:06.884 --> 00:00:09.629
But there's potentially a lot more work that you'll need to do

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.110
depending on which enhanced E-commerce features you want to populate.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.939
There will be additional configuration for defining your checkout funnel steps as well.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.330
Note that while basic E-commerce uses a Google Analytics tag

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.599
in GTM with tag type set to transaction.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.400
Enhanced Ecommerce data piggybacks on a regular page view or event tag.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.100
So, you'll need to configure your page view or

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.135
event tag with the enable enhanced ecommerce functionality checkbox.

00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:38.439
I would recommend selecting use data layer,

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:40.689
which is also a checkbox setting.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:44.609
This will allow GTM to pick up the enhanced E-commerce dimensions

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.530
and metrics that you or your developers have written to the data layer,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.335
and we'll pass appropriately formatted Google Analytics E-commerce hit data.

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:58.549
So here, we're looking at a data layer push for an event addToCart.

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:00.679
When somebody adds an item to their cart,

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.700
you push this information in the data layer,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.340
and you want to include the E-commerce action,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.615
which is the addToCart,

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:09.379
and then you also want to include that data for

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:11.209
the individual product that is being added to

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:14.004
the cart that's highlighted in yellow below.

00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:18.679
Here's what an E-commerce purchase data layer pushed might look like.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.220
This is a perfectly working example.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.004
Again, you can consult the documentation and pick what works best for you,

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.284
in terms of what data you want to send in and in what format,

00:01:29.284 --> 00:01:33.709
but this is a standard data layer.push for E-commerce purchase.

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.664
It has the transaction ID,

00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:38.880
and it has the notations here from the support documentation of

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:42.974
recommended data to include as well as items that are required,

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:45.890
so a transaction ID is required.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.004
Again, for a product,

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.619
you either have to have a name or ID.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.200
We recommend both.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.365
You can send multiple products,

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:58.009
and each product would be listed in its own data layer object.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.490
So, just make sure that you follow the proper formatting guidelines for

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:06.214
this hit information in order for it to get picked up by Google Tag Manager properly.

00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:09.710
Let's just circle back to the GA admin settings that you'll

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.235
need to populate Enhanced Ecommerce data into your view.

00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:16.264
Briefly, in the analytics interface,

00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:19.730
under View Settings, Ecommerce Settings,

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.824
you can see that there's a slider for enable E-commerce on or off,

00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:28.125
and then enable enhanced E-commerce reporting on and off.

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:30.935
With enhanced E-commerce reporting on,

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:36.900
you also have the ability to define the funnel steps for your checkout behavior.
