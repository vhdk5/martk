00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
This is a lesson about e-commerce tracking in Google Analytics.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.250
We'll start with an overview of basic e-commerce compared with enhanced e-commerce.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.710
Then, we'll move into configuration settings for

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.900
basic e-commerce tracking followed by

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.660
configuration settings for enhanced e-commerce tracking.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.179
We'll continue the discussion of shopping and

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.390
checkout behavior funnels for drop-off analysis,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.969
segmentation, and remarketing purposes.

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.809
Finally, we'll wrap up with e-commerce tracking and mobile apps.

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:29.399
As a general note,

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.579
e-commerce tracking, especially enhanced e-commerce tracking,

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.309
is considerably more complex than most of

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.530
the implementation steps we've discussed in previous lessons.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.270
But the benefit is much richer reporting and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.465
deeper insights into your online e-commerce processes.

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:46.220
If you're not a developer yourself,

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.859
this lesson should enable you to work with your developer to take

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.159
advantage of e-commerce reporting in Google Analytics.
