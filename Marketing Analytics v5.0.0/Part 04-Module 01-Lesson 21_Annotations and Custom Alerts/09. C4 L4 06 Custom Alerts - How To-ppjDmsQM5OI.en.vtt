00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
Now that we've helped navigate how to best

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:05.699
determine the conditions for some of your custom alerts,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.759
we'll move back to the Google merchandise Store demo account,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.289
where we've looked through their analytics to come up with a good candidate for an alert.

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.524
Because this is an e-commerce site,

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:17.170
we started by looking at revenue,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.975
because that tends to be one of the most important metrics.

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:23.120
Look at what happened to this revenue stream,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.394
going back to what looks like March.

00:00:26.394 --> 00:00:30.710
Now, this is a trend that was begging to be noticed and corrected,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.484
and which we will now set up an alert to prevent it from

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:36.424
ever going unnoticed again. Think about it.

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:38.599
None of the possible causes here a good.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.170
Website issues like a broken shopping cart,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.500
poor SEO, old products that aren't exciting.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.740
Now, natural thought is that maybe this is due to a seasonal trend,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.664
it's spring when it starts.

00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:53.810
Now, that's something we can easily check just to make sure,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.530
and we do that by comparing this to the prior year.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.299
Now, this is really telling.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.519
Despite the fact that the two years look relatively different,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.088
we do see that last year there was this trend of relative stability,

00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:09.575
while during this year,

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:11.555
we've had this significant drop,

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:14.270
which was predicated by this other drop.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:16.390
We also see that last year,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.859
it turned something around in June,

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.394
where we are just continuing the flounder during the current year.

00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:25.209
Now, if this is my site,

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:27.299
I've seen enough to confirm that moving forward,

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.054
I want some notification about any other kind of drop here.

00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:37.405
To do this, we begin by going to the customization menu and selecting "Custom Alerts".

00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:42.465
Similarly, you can access custom alerts by going into

00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:45.710
the "Admin" settings under the "View" because these

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.564
are configured at the view level and clicking "Custom Alerts".

00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:53.239
You'll see that we have no alerts for this view established,

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:57.170
which we're going to go ahead and we're going to create a new one.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.400
First thing that we're going to need to figure out is what to name it.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.020
Now, we know that this is going to be based on revenue,

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:06.289
we know this is going to be based on a decline.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.930
We can see the names of some other custom alerts that have been created and deprecated,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.800
but we don't see one just like ours.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.830
Revenue decline week over week,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.115
for us, it's 10 percent or more.

00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:26.340
Now, because we're working in the master view,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.430
it's automatically going to be applied here.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.349
If we wanted to add it to any other views,

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.074
we could also do that at the same time.

00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:34.549
We're not going to do that in this case.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.480
We know that this refers to a period of a week.

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.614
We want this by email.

00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:45.050
Now, when this is "Send me an email" then 'me' is actually referring to whoever is logged

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.880
in whatever Google account is being used to access analytics at this time.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.409
We have the opportunity to add other email addresses here and to configure

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.280
our mobile phones for text messaging alerts if we choose to do them.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.909
All right, let's get to the conditions.

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.840
We know that this is going to apply to all traffic at the point

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.754
when revenue has a percentage decrease.

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:12.884
Now, we want to catch it at 10 percent,

00:03:12.884 --> 00:03:14.854
so we're going to put nine percent here.

00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:17.599
When the decrease is more than nine percent,

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.604
which for us we want it to start at 10 percent compared to the previous week,

00:03:21.604 --> 00:03:24.264
we go ahead and we click "Save Alert".

00:03:24.264 --> 00:03:28.259
It says success and now it appears here.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:29.974
So, that's it.

00:03:29.974 --> 00:03:34.699
Google Analytics will now monitor our data and when these conditions fall into place,

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.729
generate the notification to be sent to us usually the next day.

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:43.219
Now, editing and deleting custom alerts is done from here as well.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.055
If you wanted to go ahead and edit this,

00:03:46.055 --> 00:03:47.900
you would just click on it,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.990
make your changes and click "Save".

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.485
If you decided that you didn't want the alert peer anymore,

00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:56.270
go ahead and click "Remove",

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.750
it would ask you to confirm and you would click "Okay".

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.689
Clients sometimes ask how often to expect alerts and I tell them that ideally,

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.969
you'll expect every alert you'll get.

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:09.349
If that's the case,

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.349
then you have an idea of the cause of an alert once you see it in

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.495
your inbox and consent about confirming that cause and effect relationship.

00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:19.774
It's important not to assume it's correct.

00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:22.474
If you get an alert that you're not expecting,

00:04:22.475 --> 00:04:24.379
it's important not to overreact,

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.735
whether it's a positive or a negative.

00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:28.895
Often with a little bit of looking,

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:31.909
you'll see it that while perhaps unexpected and alert was

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.435
triggered by easily explainable factors like seasonality.

00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:38.209
But you do need to compare to seasonal trends from

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:42.099
previous years if your GA data goes back 13 months or more.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.000
Or otherwise, track down the cost till you really know what's happening in your data.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.209
All of the products, product features, hints,

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:54.109
and tools that we've covered in this course are intended to help you manage

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.660
your data and get the most out of it in a streamlined and as clear away as possible.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.270
Understanding that the problems that are most

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:04.805
likely to be fixed are those that are noticed,

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:09.500
it's always important to strive for simplicity in your implementation and clarity

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.524
in your presentation and to keep looking for ways to optimize your approach.

00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:17.659
As you are learning and experience increase,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.064
you'll identify more and more ways to do this.

00:05:21.064 --> 00:05:27.185
Keeping the most important data visible and contextualized maximizes the potential impact

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:29.480
for Google Analytics to make a difference for

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.890
your website and the goals that you're trying to achieve with it.
