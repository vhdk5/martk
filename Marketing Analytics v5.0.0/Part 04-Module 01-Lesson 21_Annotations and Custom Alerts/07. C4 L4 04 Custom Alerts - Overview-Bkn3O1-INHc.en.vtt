00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
In addition to recording context for your data by

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.134
using the annotations function in Google Analytics,

00:00:06.134 --> 00:00:09.480
you can also implement a feature called custom alerts

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.410
to help monitor your analytics for changes in your data.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.390
Custom alerts are notifications that are triggered when certain data thresholds are

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.115
realized or trans identified based on conditions that you choose.

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:26.939
This provides a convenient automated method for you to be notified

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.260
when something happens in your data that might require your attention.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.230
We're going to talk about what you need to know about

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:36.899
your own data to create effective alerts,

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.210
help you narrow down some metrics that might make

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.850
sense for you to monitor depending on your site,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.510
and give you a sample set of alerts that you can work

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:47.599
from if you're really having a hard time getting started.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.870
As you'll see, you can set up custom alerts for

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:55.009
almost any metric and dimension combination in Google Analytics,

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:57.379
and that can be a bit overwhelming.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.980
Even though configuring these alerts is pretty straightforward,

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.594
it's best if you do a little bit of planning ahead of time.

00:01:04.594 --> 00:01:08.120
For now, we're going to have you begin thinking about

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.219
some potential conditions that you'd want to be alerted for,

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.094
and we'll see if you can make a custom alert for exactly that.

00:01:15.094 --> 00:01:17.914
Some examples for you to think about are;

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:21.484
what filter and metric combinations are important?

00:01:21.484 --> 00:01:27.064
How big or small does the change need to be in order for it to be important to you?

00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:31.159
Does this condition need to be checked or compared daily?

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.784
Weekly? Or monthly?

00:01:33.784 --> 00:01:37.819
You're trying to get the ultimate combination of notifications you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.409
need at the right interval to ensure that you can take action.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.968
But before you get carried away setting up dozens of daily alerts,

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:50.000
let's talk a little bit about alert timing.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.840
Many users mistakenly create too many and too frequent alerts especially daily ones,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.980
based on a mistaken assumption that alerts are generated in real time,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.930
that's not the case.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.305
Custom alerts are typically generated and sent

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:09.770
at the end of the period in which the conditions were met,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.890
not as soon as the conditions were met.

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:16.069
This is often much later than you would prefer to have

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.250
notification about any kind of critical failure.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.175
Because of this, custom alerts do not provide and should not be considered an alternative

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:27.230
for real-time monitoring and

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:31.715
real-time notification for changes in mission-critical metrics.

00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:34.939
The other thing that can happen if alerts are generating

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.270
too frequently is that their importance tends to fade,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.090
and you may begin ignoring them which defeats

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.349
the whole reason you created them in the first place.
