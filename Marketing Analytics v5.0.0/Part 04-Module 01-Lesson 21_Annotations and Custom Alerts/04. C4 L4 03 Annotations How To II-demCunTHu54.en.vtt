00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Let's go through how we can create,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.174
edit, and delete our own annotations.

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:08.309
From scratch, you could begin by just simply

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.970
clicking the little down tab under the timeline.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.910
You'll see the list of annotations that we already

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.405
have which we'll also see the option to create a new annotation.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:20.580
You want to select the date that you want

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.619
the annotation to be associated with, and again,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.585
that date has to exist in the range that you've selected with the date range selector.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:30.089
Let's go ahead and do July 15th,

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.270
because it's there and we'll call this a test

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.990
annotation for excellent students exclamation point.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.195
Go ahead and click "Save."

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:45.965
You'll see that it appends itself by date range,

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:48.680
so if we had made this say for July 5th,

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.854
it would have put a self between the 4th and the 9th.

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:57.154
Now, deleting and editing annotations is similarly intuitive,

00:00:57.155 --> 00:00:59.240
because I created all of these I do have

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.850
control over editing them and deleting them from here.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.750
We'll go ahead and delete.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.909
We'll go back to March so we can catch our fun one.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.564
Pretty sure that this Ides of March Office Decor Sale was not a real thing.

00:01:16.564 --> 00:01:20.814
We'll go ahead and edit,

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.810
and here you see the option to delete.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.534
It's going to ask you if you're sure,

00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:28.519
yes we are, and we'll get rid of it.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:33.670
Let's just say that I realized that I didn't want to use the word excellent,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.430
let me go ahead and click "Edit."

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.569
We can go ahead and change anything that we want in here,

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.559
you can even change the date and re-associate it with another date if you want

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.375
to and make that awesome students and click "Save."

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:49.995
That's it. Now remember,

00:01:49.995 --> 00:01:54.290
nothing that we just did is going to impact anyone because these were

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.015
all private for me and made up and only I could see them.

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:03.109
This may be very different than what you're dealing with depending

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.179
on what your permissions are and whether or not

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.385
you choose to share your annotations with others,

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:09.469
so proceed with appropriate caution.

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:14.359
Well, there are some considerations about functionality that are helpful to know

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.000
as you begin working with annotations and before we leave

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.090
the subject to move on the custom alerts which is next.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.360
The first is if there isn't currently a way to timestamp

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.120
an annotation with a day or with an hour or a minute.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.530
Or to set one that spans a range of dates and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.224
the annotation may only be associated with one specific date.

00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:40.449
Second, you may have noticed when you create a new annotation.

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:46.189
If the interface limits you to 160 characters per annotation and this provides you with

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.009
a paradox to navigate and that is how to be clear

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.324
and explicit while being required to be brief.

00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:54.709
That's right. Our recommendation is that you be as

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.530
specific as you can in those 160 characters

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.905
because the more specific you are now the more helpful it will be farther down the road.

00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:07.069
Now, you'll likely immediately turn to using abbreviations and acronyms.

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.254
Just a quick note,

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:10.250
make sure that they're ones that are

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.330
well-known to the potential audience who'll be looking at your annotations.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.070
If you have your own acronym that you use for something that nobody knows what it means,

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.109
putting it in here is not going to be helpful.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.515
That's a place to use up some of your characters and be more explicit.

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:28.259
The last thing to consider is that when you export,

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.370
let's say we wanted to export this report to a PDF.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.325
This is going to take a few moments.

00:03:34.324 --> 00:03:39.289
Here we go. You can see now that our report has rendered and downloaded.

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.014
We go ahead and open this.

00:03:41.014 --> 00:03:44.029
You will see that nowhere does the text from any

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.134
of our annotations exist on the export of this report.

00:03:47.134 --> 00:03:50.239
All of it shows are the texts bubbles to let you

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.555
know that there are annotations for those states.

00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:56.150
Creating and editing annotations is

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.245
an important component of maintaining a healthy GA implementation.

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:04.909
But also remember that when you have access to others analytics you should be checking

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.889
their annotations too as a potential first-place to answer your questions.

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.084
If they've done a good job with their annotations,

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:17.329
the simple bits of functionality will save you a tremendous amount of

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.584
complicated digging leaving you time to see to

00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:24.620
other aspects of your implementation and analysis.
