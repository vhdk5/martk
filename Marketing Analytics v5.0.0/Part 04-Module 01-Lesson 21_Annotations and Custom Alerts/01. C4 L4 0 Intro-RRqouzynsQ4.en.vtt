When it comes to reporting and keeping track of your data and results,

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:08.009
it's important to also keep track of some of the actions you may have

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.929
taken or some of the events that may have occurred that had an influence on your data.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.489
Google Analytics lets you add notes to reports in the form of annotations,

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:22.604
which can be very helpful reminders down the line to help you understand data trends.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:26.609
Google also lets you set up alerts that can be helpful to draw

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.019
your attention to important changes in the data patterns for your site.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.269
