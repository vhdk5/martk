00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.459
Now it's time to go back into the Google Analytics Interface and look under the hood.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:09.719
We'll start by checking out the annotations that we teased about earlier,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.230
and then demonstrate creating and editing your own annotations.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.899
You remember these three texts bubbles from earlier.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:22.719
Well, each of them corresponds to an annotation that's been made to a date in this range.

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:24.949
These bubbles are the only visual cue,

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.530
that some information is aligned to these dates.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.200
We can pull down this little tab, and they will show up.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.320
Another way to get them to show up is to actually just,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.609
click on one of them.

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.369
But there is something important to remember, and that is that,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:41.839
the only annotations that are included in your selected date range,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.490
will show up on this list.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.785
This is not an all-inclusive list,

00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:47.073
that you can scroll,

00:00:47.073 --> 00:00:50.274
to go backwards or forwards from the date range that you've selected.

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:56.254
So, for example, if we wanted to see if there were any annotations made in March,

00:00:56.255 --> 00:01:00.020
we would actually have to widen our date range,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.865
with the date range selector.

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:07.019
Let Google Analytics do its thing, and check again.

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:11.655
Sure enough, there is a annotation that was made on March 15th,

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:13.605
about the Ides of March clearance sale.

00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:15.585
We'll take care of that later.

00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:18.789
Now, you've probably noticed that,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.760
all of these are marked as private.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.760
Private is one of the two types of annotations.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.530
It means that, only I,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.064
who is the person who created these annotations,

00:01:29.064 --> 00:01:30.560
will be able to see them.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.409
These are all marked as private,

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.450
due to limited access given to us,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.760
as users of the Google Analytics Merchandise Store.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.730
However, when you have Collaborate Access to a Google Analytics view,

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.799
you'll be able to choose the option to create

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.939
the second kind of annotation, which is shared.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.614
Shared annotations can be seen by any GA users who have access to a properties reports.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.494
That can be a diverse audience.

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:59.375
So it's important to be mindful of what you're sharing.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:04.310
Also, while annotations are shared across reports in the same view,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.939
they are not shared among views in the same property.

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.069
So, make sure everyone is making their annotations,

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.099
in the organizations designated main working view.
