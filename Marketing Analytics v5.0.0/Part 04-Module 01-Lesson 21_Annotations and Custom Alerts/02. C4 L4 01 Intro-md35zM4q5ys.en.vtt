00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
Our next concept seems very simple and it is,

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.070
but it holds the potential to be

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.699
a tremendous time-saver and can become an excellent first place

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.250
to look for answers to questions about changes

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.519
that you observe in your Google Analytics Data.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.689
Proper and consistent use of the annotations function,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.420
which allows you to leave notes that are date stamped in

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.550
Google analytics can provide a historical record of occurrences, events, initiatives,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.894
and changes both internal and external, intentional,

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:35.894
and accidental that could impact how your data looks and is reflected in your reports.

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:39.600
We know that there's a timeline on the audience overview.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.454
So, let's quickly go there.

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:43.909
So, here's our timeline graph.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.149
Here, you can see that some annotations exist because

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.719
of these little word bubbles that exist on the timeline.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.225
I wonder what they say.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:53.820
Well we're going to find out.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.179
But first we want to talk about and list for you

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.189
some potential instances when leaving annotations might be best warranted.

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:06.700
You and your team can use annotations to help explain changes that occur in your data.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.795
So, anything that stands to cause a spike or a drop is an excellent candidate.

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:18.349
These include, new marketing campaigns or instances of ongoing campaigns such as email,

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:22.844
design and development changes on your site, new products,

00:01:22.844 --> 00:01:25.730
mass media marketing, and changes to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.755
your actual GA implementation such as creating filters or goals.

00:01:30.754 --> 00:01:34.729
Now, those are some examples of things that you want to cause a spike.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.990
But what about some things that might cause your data to dip for a period of time?

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:42.064
Minutes can make a difference in some instances,

00:01:42.064 --> 00:01:44.480
but what about hours or days?

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.910
If any of the following things occur,

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.979
we recommend you go into Google Analytics and create an annotation to record it.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.870
You'll be glad you did.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.325
If you experience server issues from short-term to a complete website outage altogether,

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:02.755
go ahead and get that recorded.

00:02:02.754 --> 00:02:08.810
Anything that occurs that causes user sentiment about your brand can drop or spike.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.340
For example a poor or excellent earnings report for a big company,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.895
or negative or positive PR incident that goes viral.

00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:20.510
These are things that can cause changes that you'll want to be able to put

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:25.024
your fingertips on when you notice the dips are spikes in your data.

00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:28.189
We're also aware of some organizations that make

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.819
annotations around production shutdowns that they have;

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.250
known seasonality surrounding their products or

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.569
services and even holidays that impact website traffic.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.449
It's simple notes like these that can often be

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.089
especially overlooked when looking at data dips.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.270
Because the first thing that we tend to do when we see a data dip,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.945
is go to the worst and unforeseen kinds of explanations.

00:02:50.944 --> 00:02:54.109
This can save you from heading down that rabbit hole.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.860
Using annotations can be a hard habit to get into,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.930
because you're certain in the moment that you'll just

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.064
remember the causes for these spikes and these dips.

00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:06.379
But given the pace of our lives and this industry,

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.889
is just not humanly possible for most people to do that.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.519
Our advice is always to record these occurrences as

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.310
annotations where you can always find reference and context exactly where you need it,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.189
along the date and the Google Analytics interface,

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.530
no matter how far in the future you might need it.
