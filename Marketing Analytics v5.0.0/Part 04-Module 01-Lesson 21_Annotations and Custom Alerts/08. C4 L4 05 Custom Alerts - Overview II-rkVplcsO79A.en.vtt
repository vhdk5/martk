00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
The custom alerts you choose to configure will ultimately depend

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:07.634
on the types and volume of traffic you have and other variables.

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:11.699
So it helps to think about metrics based on a few major areas.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.000
Overall usage; this refers to visits,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.434
visitors, page views, time on-page, and bounce rate.

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:22.289
E-commerce metrics; conversions, transactions,

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.824
and revenue come to mind immediately.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:28.019
Goals; If you have goals configured,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.919
you would usually want to know about changes and your goal conversion rates.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.130
We recommend at a minimum that you begin by

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.000
monitoring for these areas if they were applicable to your implementation,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.119
and here are some ideas for how to get started.

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:44.334
For overall site usage,

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:49.954
begin with monitoring for a 10 percent weekly increase or decrease in total sessions.

00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:51.949
You can then go in and troubleshoot for

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.310
example what channels are seeing a dip in performance.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.170
This is often easier than setting up custom alerts for the performance of every channel.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.355
If you're engaging in e-commerce,

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:05.599
consider alerts for a 10 percent weekly increase or

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:08.905
decrease in both conversion rate and revenue,

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:10.599
and if you set up goals,

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:14.509
it implies a level of importance that you get conversions for them.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.065
Begin by monitoring for a 10 percent weekly increase

00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:22.000
or decrease in goal conversion rate for each of your goals.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.385
Or you can use goal value as a proxy for

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.340
actual goal completions if you have goal value

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.000
configured as Eric demonstrated in a previous lesson.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.370
As you get to know your data,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.579
you may need to go in and adjust some of these conditions.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.344
We've provided them to you here as just a basic starting point.

00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:43.969
Now that you have some guidance in hand to help you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.810
determine what custom alerts you should consider creating,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.710
we're going to head into the interface and set one up,

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.619
so you can see exactly how easy it is once you've done a little bit of earlier work.
