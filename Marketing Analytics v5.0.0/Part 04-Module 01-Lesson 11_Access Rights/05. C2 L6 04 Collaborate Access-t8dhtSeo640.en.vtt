00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.844
Collaborate is a user permission level that allows a user to create,

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:07.619
edit, delete, and share assets.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.585
The user can collaborate on shared assets like a dashboard or an annotation.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.325
This permission level also includes read and analyze privileges.

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:22.785
We recommend assigning collaborate access to internal users in your business.

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:27.254
Assets in Google Analytics include objects like annotations,

00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:29.730
attribution models, channel groupings,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.964
custom reports, and dashboards.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:34.515
Let's look at annotations as an example.

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:39.120
Over time, you'll design custom assets and you're going to want to share them internally.

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:41.934
Let's look at annotations as an example.

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:44.150
Let's say you made a change to your site and

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.189
you wanted to record the date of the change in

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:52.174
GA. You could create a personal note for yourself or a shared note in the account.

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:54.079
Here, you see shared notes about

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.530
important changes made to the Google merchandise store account.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.350
If someone in the company is working on analysis and seeing strange trends in the data,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.185
notes like these are provide important context.

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:09.094
We recommend giving internal users in your business

00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:14.859
collaborate access so that they can access notes like these and other shared assets.
