00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
The power of Google Analytics lies in customizing it to suit your needs.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.275
That means, making changes to your account.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:10.455
Over time, you'll add properties, customized views,

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:13.650
create filters, set up goals and add users.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.144
At some point, you may need to look back at the changes you've made.

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:20.189
Change history gives you a record of these changes.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.440
This feature is located in the Google Analytics admin page under the account column.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.020
If you don't see change history in an account,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.439
that means you do not have edit permission in that account.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.280
You need the edit permission level to see change history.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.530
Change history has three columns of

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.164
information: Column one is the date and time of the change.

00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:46.609
Column two, the email of the Analytics user who made the change,

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.125
and column three is a description of the change that was made.

00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:55.519
change history keeps a record of activities for the most recent 180 days.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.890
If you delete a user from your account,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.710
you will still see that user's activity but instead

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.439
of the email of the user who performed the change,

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.859
you'll see the words deleted user in column two.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.579
Google cannot retrieve the deleted email address.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.224
If you delete an account, property or view,

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:16.369
it will go into the Trash Can.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.055
You have 35 days to reverse this action before the item is permanently deleted.

00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:26.860
You need edit permission on the account to access the Trash Can.

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.709
It's important to note that,

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:34.219
restoring an account will automatically restore its properties and views.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.525
If you put a property or view in the Trash Can directly however,

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:42.455
you have to retrieve that property or that view.

00:01:42.454 --> 00:01:47.015
When you restore an account property or view from the Trash Can,

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:49.640
settings like goals, filters,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.170
user permissions and links to other Google products are preserved.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.295
You do however lose data.

00:01:57.295 --> 00:02:00.210
Data is not processed while accounts,

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.059
properties, and views are in the Trash Can.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.780
Data processing resumes for core reports within an hour of being restored.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.919
Data for real-time reports resumes within seconds.

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:17.239
Use change history to stay on top of the changes in your account.
