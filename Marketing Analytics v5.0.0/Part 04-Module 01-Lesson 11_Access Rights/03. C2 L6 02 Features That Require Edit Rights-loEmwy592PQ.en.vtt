When assigning user permissions,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.530
one of the options that you have is edit rights.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.580
You can assign this permission at the account property and view levels.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.370
Edit rights allow the user to add, edit,

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.410
or delete accounts, properties,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.495
views, filters, and goals.

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:18.464
They also allow the user to see report data.

00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:21.804
Edit rights include collaborate rights.

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:27.750
Here, you see a filter and you have the option to add filter when you have edit rights.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.210
The same is true for goals.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.210
Edit rights is one of the user permissions that allows you to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.719
