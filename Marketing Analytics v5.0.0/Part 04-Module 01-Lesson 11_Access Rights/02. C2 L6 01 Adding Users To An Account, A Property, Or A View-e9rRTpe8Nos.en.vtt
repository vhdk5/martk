00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
You can add users to

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.609
your Google Analytics account at different levels of the account hierarchy.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.500
Where you add a user determines

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.085
their initial access so it's important to understand the structure.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:14.685
The highest level of the account hierarchy is organization.

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:18.554
Next is account, then property, and then view.

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:22.949
You add users in the admin section in Google Analytics.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.174
You need manage users permission at the account property or view level to add users.

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:32.009
So, for example, if you click "User Management" at

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.744
the account level in the Google merchandise store,

00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:37.574
you'll see that although you have access to the account,

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:41.155
you need the write permission level to add new users.

00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:43.079
Each time you add a new user,

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.589
the key question to ask is do you want the user to have access to the entire account,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.480
certain properties in the account,

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.549
or just certain views?

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.854
Let's use an example to explore this question.

00:00:55.854 --> 00:01:00.529
In this example, you have a parent organization that owns a media company.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.890
The media company has several digital brands.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.704
Each brand would have its own property and each property could have specific views.

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:12.950
Let's say one of the brands is The Huffington Post to make this more realistic.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.519
The parent organization is Verizon Communications.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:19.609
They have a media company called Oath Inc.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.510
If you added the user at the organization or account level,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.540
the user would have access to all of the properties and views in

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.185
the account with the same set of permissions that you use.

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:34.969
If you add the user at the property level so at The Huffington Post property,

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.980
then the user would only have access to

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.560
that property with the permissions that you provide.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.549
Let's say you were the analytics manager and you wanted to create a view that only had

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.465
analytics data for the podcast section of The Huffington Post.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:51.965
You could use a filter to create that view and share it with all of your podcasters.

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:54.500
They would only have access to analytics data for

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.739
this view keeping all other analytics data private.

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.349
This is one way you can leverage views.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.709
We'll explore this concept further later on in the course.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.689
Once you've selected a level,

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.900
go to the desired account property or view.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.034
Click "User Management."

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:12.884
In the account users list,

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:16.209
you click "Plus" then click "Add new users."

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.730
Enter the email address for the user's Google account,

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.729
select the permissions you want, and click "Add."
