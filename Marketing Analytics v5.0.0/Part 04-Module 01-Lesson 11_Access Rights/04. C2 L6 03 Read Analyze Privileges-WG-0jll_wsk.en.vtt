00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.299
Let's say you want to share Google Analytics data with a user on

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.379
your team or maybe even a vendor or a freelancer that works with your company,

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.070
consider using Read and Analyze User Permission.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.609
Read and analyze allows the user to see report data,

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.820
filter a table, add a secondary dimension,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.399
create a segment, create and share personal assets like segments or custom reports,

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.409
and see shared assets.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.804
Keep in mind you can assign Read and Analyze at either the account,

00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:33.310
property or view level in the account hierarchy.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.280
The key question to ask here is do you want someone to be able to read and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.920
analyze at the entire account level including all properties and views?

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.635
Do you want to limit the access to just one property or two?

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:48.829
Or do you want to limit the access to the view level?
