00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
In this section, we talk about behavioral segments.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.360
You won't see behavioral segments anywhere

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.225
in the Google Analytics interface under that name.

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:12.629
But we're referring to the segments as behavioral segments

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.929
because they're based on very specific user behaviors.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.789
As we know in Google Analytics,

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.425
when we're talking about behaviors,

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:23.265
we're basically talking about page views and events.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:25.914
But before we define behavioral segments,

00:00:25.914 --> 00:00:28.804
let's consider a philosophical question.

00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:31.969
If you have a help page or an FAQ section on

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.140
your website or even let's say an about us page,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.189
what's the purpose of that page?

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:42.844
The immediate reason of course is to provide help or to provide some form of information.

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:46.159
But the ultimate reason that we go through the trouble of developing

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.969
the supplemental pages is to increase conversions.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.000
If our model is transactional in any way,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.195
we want to drive towards increased conversions.

00:00:56.195 --> 00:01:00.320
Let's say that you have included a video on your transactional website.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.335
What's the purpose of the video?

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:05.659
The immediate reason is to inform or entertain,

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.140
and we want to be able to measure how many times the video is viewed.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.599
Ultimately, the reason that we post the video on

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:16.114
a transactional site in most cases is to increase conversions.

00:01:16.114 --> 00:01:18.890
We don't want to go through the trouble and expense of

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.430
producing a video just to have visitors watch the video.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.270
We want the video to positively influence conversions.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:29.634
With this, let's define some behavioral segments.

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:31.575
On the Google Merchandise Store,

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.284
we see that there's a help page.

00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:36.679
Is this help page having a positive impact on conversions?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
Let's start by going to the all pages report in

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.600
Google Analytics and seeing which page we have to base our segment on.

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:45.979
Let's copy this value.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.585
We'll click Add Segment.

00:01:47.584 --> 00:01:49.729
In this case, we don't have a segment

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.070
that's already been defined that we could start with.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.889
So, we will have to define a new segment from scratch.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.560
We'll click New Segment.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.980
What we're going to do is actually skip over all of these starting conditions.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.219
We're going to have more options if we click Conditions.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.155
So, when you're defining a new segment,

00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:07.519
go write that conditions,

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:09.889
everything that we need will be available there.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.559
Conditions. Where we see conversion probability,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.159
this is actually just a drop down of all of

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.120
the dimensions and metrics we have to work with when creating segments.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.360
Now, this segment is a behavioral segment based on a page dimension.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.225
What's important to recognize,

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:30.949
when you're defining a segment based on page,

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.439
you're not saying I only want to see that page,

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:34.909
that wouldn't make any sense.

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.444
We could do that with a regular table filter.

00:02:37.444 --> 00:02:39.349
What we're doing here is we're saying,

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.549
"I want to see all sessions that included

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.719
a page that exactly matches frequently asked questions."

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.960
We're pulling in the entire session,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.064
not just that one page you hit within the session.

00:02:54.064 --> 00:02:56.704
The page view is characterizing this session.

00:02:56.705 --> 00:02:59.495
It's a behavioral segment based on pageview.

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:01.015
We'll call this segment.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:05.579
FAQ Page Viewed, click Save.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.540
Let's also add all users.

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:13.299
If we navigate to the goal overview page with all users in fact page

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.910
viewed segments still applied and we select Goal 1: Purchase Completed,

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.349
we can see that

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.180
the FAQ Page Viewed conversion rate was higher than the conversion rate for all users.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.860
Now, it's not time to celebrate quite yet because we need to remember that

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.140
the FAQ Page Viewed segment is including

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.909
any session in which the FAQ page was viewed at any time,

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.189
that could have been after the transaction as well.

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.219
So, now we're going to create a different type of segment,

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:46.270
a sequence segment to determine if the FAQ page was in

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.805
fact viewed before the transaction in most cases, new segment.

00:03:50.805 --> 00:03:54.064
This time we'll define a segment based on sequences.

00:03:54.064 --> 00:03:55.729
Give ourselves some more room.

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:00.405
Step one page, exactly matches.

00:04:00.405 --> 00:04:02.594
Frequently asked questions.

00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:07.965
Add step is followed by goal on completions.

00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:11.705
We want to choose per hit so the sequence is enforced.

00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:13.100
If we said per session,

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.129
this would still mean that the goal completion could have

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.459
occurred before the view of the FAQ page.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.964
Goal 1 completion is greater than zero,

00:04:21.964 --> 00:04:30.644
and we'll call the segment FAQ Page Proceeding Goal 1 Completion.

00:04:30.644 --> 00:04:33.689
We see that of the 164 goal

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:38.334
one completions that occurred in sessions in which the FAQ page was viewed,

00:04:38.334 --> 00:04:43.414
a 120 of those goal completions occurred after the FAQ page was viewed.

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:48.235
This is pretty good but it's not quite a smashing success for the FAQ page.

00:04:48.235 --> 00:04:50.764
So, I wouldn't recommend reorganizing

00:04:50.764 --> 00:04:54.889
the navigation to get more people to the FAQ page based on this analysis.

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.784
But it was still useful to perform and certainly

00:04:57.785 --> 00:05:01.314
the FAQ page doesn't seem to be harming transactions.

00:05:01.314 --> 00:05:05.344
As an example of behavioral segments based on event data,

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:09.290
we could build segments based on video interactions of those are captured.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.330
We don't have video data in the merchandise store account,

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:15.379
but this is an example of the conversion improvement

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.870
you could see when users watch videos in sessions.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.639
We certainly have seen this kind of difference in conversion rate in

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.824
other Google Analytics accounts where video interactions are captured.

00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:28.990
How would we build these segments?

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.025
Let's see. Again, starting from pretty much any report in GA,

00:05:34.024 --> 00:05:36.634
click Add Segment, new segment.

00:05:36.634 --> 00:05:38.764
We'll go right down to conditions.

00:05:38.764 --> 00:05:41.824
In this case we're going to use three different dimensions.

00:05:41.824 --> 00:05:46.829
We're going to start with event category, exactly matches video.

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:50.750
Now, if we wanted to create a segment just for any sessions in

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.694
which users interacted with any video in any way,

00:05:54.694 --> 00:05:57.404
this would suffice as the segment definition.

00:05:57.404 --> 00:05:59.699
But we're going to get more specific.

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.149
Event action, exactly matches.

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:09.549
Start on whatever you're using for your event action and event label,

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.829
exactly matches whatever the name of your video is.

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:17.449
Now, we're not getting any dynamic matching in the merchandise store account,

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.959
because these events values aren't matching anything that's currently captured,

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:23.989
but this would be the process of defining a segment for

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.319
all sessions in which users started your company video.

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.420
We can name this segment apply it.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.319
We could define a sequence segment in the same way with

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:38.199
these dimensions being the first step and then transactions or goal completions,

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.664
greater than zero, as a second step.

00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:45.200
Again, once we applied these segments we'd be able to see if

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:49.750
there was a correlation between video viewing and increase conversion rate.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.329
In this case, the conversion rate for the video viewed segment

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:57.094
is a lot higher than for all users and we do also see that

00:06:57.095 --> 00:07:01.250
891 of the 1,064 video viewed

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:06.170
transactions did occur when the video was viewed before the transaction.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.620
So, in this case, it's probably fair to say that the video is

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.300
a good thing and we want to try to get more users to watch it.
