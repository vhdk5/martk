00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.955
Dynamic remarketing goes beyond what can be referred to as regular remarketing.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:10.769
Dynamic remarketing is based on specific product or service pageviews,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.330
and the real dynamic part of

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.379
dynamic remarketing is generating highly customized ad creatives.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.629
This of course comes with a price.

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:20.669
Dynamic remarketing does require

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.720
significant additional configuration versus regular remarketing,

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.779
but we do get a good start with schemas for different types of

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.214
verticals that we can configure dynamic remarketing for.

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:34.109
Let's consider the example of a user who

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.049
views the great Google hoodie on the Google Merchandise Store.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:40.919
If the merchandise store team chose to do so,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.160
they could implement dynamic remarketing.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.069
So, when that same visitor was on another property,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.715
they could see an ad creative that's specifically contains the gray hoodie.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:52.405
Similar for vertical such as real estate,

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:55.039
if a visitor has viewed a specific home,

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.689
you as an advertiser,

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.774
could present that same home in an ad to the user when they're visiting other websites.

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:06.049
We can see that there are several schemas available for different verticals.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.284
These schemas will allow us to configure

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:11.750
the additional information that the dynamic ads are generated from.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.549
But before we look at the schemas,

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.924
let's walk through the process of configuring dynamic remarketing.

00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:19.579
For dynamic remarketing, we're going to be working

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.349
with Google Analytics and Google AdWords,

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:24.274
and several steps will be required.

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:26.480
First, we're going to have to create

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.450
at least one custom dimension that will serve as

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.875
the key for that product or service such as product ID.

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:36.379
We'll then need to take the custom dimension or custom dimensions,

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:41.329
and map them as dynamic attributes to be used for dynamic remarketing.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.980
We'll then need to create

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.659
a remarketing audience such as the one that we saw previously for non converting users.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.155
On the AdWords' side,

00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:51.570
we'll need to create a display campaign.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.299
We'll target that campaign to

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.750
the remarketing audience that we've defined in Google Analytics.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.959
We'll then need to download the feed template either from AdWords or from the help pages.

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.299
We'll then need to populate that feed template with

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.930
the additional information to base the ad creative on,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.650
and will need to upload that feed to AdWords for

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.555
all schemas except for retail and for Merchant Center for the retail schema.

00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:20.930
Now, the magic happens when the dynamic attribute from

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.520
Google Analytics is joined to the feed that AdWords is using.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.230
So, Adwords knows to display

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.319
very customized ad creatives when they're

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.400
retargeting to users who visit other websites after yours.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.510
Let's checkout dynamic attributes in the Google Analytics admin,

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:43.889
and let's also take a look at the feed and the schema that's used to organize the feed.

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.464
Back in the property admin,

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:49.265
under audience definitions, we can click dynamic attributes.

00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:51.169
If we click new attribute,

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.239
we'll be asked to specify which schema,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.189
which vertical, which business type as it's called here,we want to remarket for.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.155
Let's say that we're configuring dynamic remarketing for a flight booking engine.

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:08.300
Under audience definitions, we can click dynamic attributes, new attribute.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.840
Here's where we specify the vertical referred

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.395
to here as the business type, we'll select flights.

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:19.969
We can keep the view as the main view destination account,

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:24.669
specify the AdWords account that we want to configure dynamic remarketing in.

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.280
Now, here's where we're setting the key based on the custom dimension or

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.020
custom dimensions that we're passing to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.365
Google Analytics when a flight results page is viewed.

00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:35.780
Destination airport is required.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.235
So again, we would have to configure this custom dimension,

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:41.600
send the custom dimension to Google analytics when

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.704
a flight pages viewed and then this would become our key.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:46.534
Now, in some cases,

00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:51.169
we can have other attributes contribute to the key as well.

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.214
If we roll over origin ID,

00:03:54.215 --> 00:03:59.705
we see that the origin ID must match values from the origin ID column in your feed.

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:01.490
This is an optional attribute,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.860
but if we want it to remark it based not only on

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.910
destination airport but on departure airport,

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.409
and we were capturing that as a custom dimension,

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.699
that would be our option,

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.584
so we could have a key based on destination,

00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:19.579
airport and origin airport referred to as destination ID,

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.069
origin ID for the dynamic attributes.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.980
The remaining attributes in this case allow you to

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.220
specify additional information that you could use in your ad.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.810
If we roll over start date,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.899
we see that if we populate this field,

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:35.149
the start date can be displayed right within the ad.

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:41.359
So, some of the additional information for the dynamic ad can come from attributes,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.814
the rest of the additional information will come from the feed that we upload.

00:04:45.814 --> 00:04:51.154
If we go back to the AdWords support pages and we click into flights,

00:04:51.154 --> 00:04:54.099
we see the schema that will be reflected in

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.350
the feed template that we can populate an upload.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.379
You can download the feed template from

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.459
AdWords or from the support pages as we can do here.

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:05.599
You could then populate this template with

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.050
the additional information about the flight and upload it to AdWords.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.275
At that point, AdWords would be able to generate

00:05:12.274 --> 00:05:16.289
highly customized ad for your target advertising audience.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.710
With these configuration steps in place,

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:22.279
Google AdWords can now display ads that are customized

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:26.869
for the specific service or product that your visitor has previously viewed.
