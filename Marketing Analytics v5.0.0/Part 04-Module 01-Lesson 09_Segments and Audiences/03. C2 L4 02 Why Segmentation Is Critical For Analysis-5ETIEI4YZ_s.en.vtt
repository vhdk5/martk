00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.794
Let's start this section by considering why we need segmentation.

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:07.500
We need segmentation as an alternative to aggregation,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.929
meaning, analyzing all your sessions,

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.134
all your users, at the same time.

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:14.460
If we want to be a little bit dramatic,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.414
we can say that aggregation is the enemy.

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:22.289
That is to say that if you're only viewing aggregated Google Analytics data,

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.355
it is likely that you're missing insights and opportunities.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.440
Segmenting, on the other hand,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.450
focuses your analysis on meaningful subgroups of users or sessions.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.995
As a result, we should be able to surface insights that

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:40.765
otherwise would remain obscured in the aggregated data.

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:43.369
Within Google Analytics, segmentation includes

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:46.369
built-in segments known as system segments,

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:49.474
and also custom segments that we define ourselves.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:51.785
Let's start with system segments.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:54.049
Systems segments can be based on

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.625
specific characteristics of your users such as mobile traffic,

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.219
device category equals mobile,

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.700
or based on overall behavior patterns such as

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.390
single session versus multi-session users, or non-bound sessions.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.650
We can define and apply a segment in almost any report in the Google Analytics UI.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.250
Let's say that we're in our landing pages report and we wanted to

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.480
evaluate bounce on landing pages for mobile device users.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.890
In a previous lesson,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.489
we saw how we could apply device category as

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:33.140
a secondary dimension and then filter for mobile on the secondary dimension.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.570
But we could take an even more direct approach by

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.984
just applying a mobile built-in segment.

00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:39.590
We'll click "Add segment."

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.510
Let's click "System" to select only the built-in system segments.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.940
We'll select "Mobile Traffic," and for now,

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.439
we'll deselect "All Users."

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.685
Now, we see that mobile traffic is applied as a segment.

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:54.859
We can see that at the top of the report,

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.745
we can also see it within the primary dimension column in the table.

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:02.704
Now, we can analyze all metrics in the table for mobile traffic only.

00:02:02.704 --> 00:02:04.939
Let's now go to the Exit Pages report,

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.549
and to play different built-in segment.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.349
We'll remove the mobile traffic segment that we applied in our previous report.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.789
The Exit Pages report is helpful because it shows us

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:21.949
the percentage of time a pageview was the last pageview in a session.

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:25.009
We know that we don't want any page that's involved in

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:29.435
a conversion process to serve as an exit page with a high percentage.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:31.670
That would not be a positive indicator.

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:34.354
But as we consider Exit Pages,

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:38.014
we want to remember that exits also include bounces.

00:02:38.014 --> 00:02:42.339
If we say to ourselves some of our visitors are always going to balance,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.050
we're never going to completely eliminate bounce rate.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.770
But what if we could segment out those visitors who do bounce?

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.625
So, we could then evaluate users who were engaged enough

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:57.125
to at least perform one additional action after landing.

00:02:57.125 --> 00:03:01.759
In this case, we can click "Add segment," we'll deselect "All

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:07.419
Users," we'll select "System," Non bounce Sessions, Apply.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.780
Now, we're able to more meaningfully evaluate exit rate for

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.189
those sessions in which users were engaged enough not to bounce to begin with.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:21.460
We're using segments to break down our audience into more meaningful subgroups.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.930
As a note, because segments require GA to perform on the fly calculations,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.465
they are sometimes subject to sampling,

00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:32.180
which we'll discuss in an upcoming lesson.
