00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
At this point, most of us are quite familiar with re-targeting,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.439
referred to as re-marketing when it's on the Google stack.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.260
With re-marketing, publishers can deliver ads based on previously visited websites.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.000
Google Analytics allows us to define these re-marketing audiences that we can then

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.949
use as advertisers on other sites that are serving as the publishers.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.769
We can re-market it to non purchasers.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.769
We can also re-market for cross-selling.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.810
Though re-marketing is sometimes seen as a mechanism to bring visitors back to convert,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.405
we can also use re-marketing to offer

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:41.910
additional information resources and engagement to users who have already converted.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.289
Re-marketing audiences allow us to connect Google Analytics

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.994
behavioral data with our advertising efforts.

00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:53.229
Audiences are defined pretty much just like custom segments.

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.584
We're also going to see why it's better to use users scope

00:00:56.585 --> 00:01:00.454
than session scope for most of our re-targeting audiences.

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:05.689
We will be able to use our audiences for AdWords re-marketing, for RSA,

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.750
for YouTube re-marketing, for re-marketing through DBM

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.879
and also for a targeted testing if we're using optimized 360.

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:19.515
Because Google re-marketing leverages the third-party double-click cookie,

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:24.575
we will want to make sure it to include this fact in our websites privacy policy.

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:29.079
Let's see how to define a re-marketing audience in Google Analytics.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.879
There are two ways to create audiences and GA. We can start with

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:38.560
an existing segment or we can create an audience from scratch.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.155
Let's look at both examples.

00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:43.570
If we have our segments panel open,

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.444
and we want to create a re-marketing audience from the non converters segment,

00:01:48.444 --> 00:01:53.769
we can click "Build audience" but we can get even more granular than that.

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:56.170
Let's define an audience from scratch.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.835
Will go to Admin,

00:01:57.834 --> 00:02:00.959
Audience definitions, out answers.

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.019
When you're first creating an audience,

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:07.000
Google Analytics does require you to create the all users audience

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.784
and verify that you have connected Google Analytics to Google AdWords,

00:02:11.784 --> 00:02:15.759
but you're probably not going to use all users for any of you re-marketing.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.715
So, let's define a more specific audience.

00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:22.935
Audience Source View will stick with are all website data view for now.

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:26.490
Next step, create new audience definition

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.500
and let's say that we are creating an audience on

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.789
a lead generation site for visitors who got to the final step into

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.544
lead submission process but did not actually submit the lead go to conditions.

00:02:38.544 --> 00:02:44.129
How would we designate users who got to the final step in the lead submission process?

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.639
We could use the page dimension.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.969
Filters sessions include Page exactly

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:56.895
matches and let's say that the Page Path is lead form,

00:02:56.895 --> 00:03:00.180
add filter, filter sessions exclude.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.040
Now, we could either use the page dimension

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.819
of the thank you page or if we already have the goal configured,

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.900
we could use goal completions.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.800
Lead submitted goal one completions per session equals zero,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.780
and we're going to make an important change.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.189
We're going to change the scope of these filters from sessions to users.

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.564
Why is it important to change the scope from sessions to users?

00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:28.479
Because if we kept the scope it's sessions and a visitor started

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.479
the lead process and got to the lead form on Monday,

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:36.649
but didn't come back and convert till Tuesday and we kept the scope to

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.050
sessions that user would still be

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.575
included in our re-targeting audience which we wouldn't want to do.

00:03:42.574 --> 00:03:49.039
We want the scope to be set to users in three cases so

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.009
that even if a user got to

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:55.834
the lead form during one session and convert it in another session,

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:59.034
that user would be excluded from the re-marketing Audience.

00:03:59.034 --> 00:04:02.134
We don't want to re-market to people who have already converted,

00:04:02.134 --> 00:04:05.149
unless that's the type of re-marketing campaign that you're running.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.640
Click "Apply" You can choose

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.384
the membership duration depending on the type of conversion cycle that you have.

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:15.109
For conversion that may take a long time,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.285
we could increase our membership duration,

00:04:17.285 --> 00:04:19.775
maximum is 540 days.

00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:22.069
Let's say for this lead submission process we're

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.469
changing the membership duration to 90 days.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.620
Now, for the look-back days that will be

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.759
the period during which the two filters can be applied.

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.810
So, Google Analytics will look at seven-day intervals to evaluate

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.730
views of the lead form page and whether or not goal one was completed.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.129
We could implement remarketing in AdWords without using Google Analytics Audiences.

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:51.889
So, what's the advantage of using Google Analytics Audiences for AdWords remarketing?

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.064
For one thing, AdWords remarketing does require an additional tag,

00:04:57.064 --> 00:05:01.209
whereas if we have Google Analytics on our website already,

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:03.829
we usually have all the tagging we need.

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:08.930
Defining your audiences in Google Analytics will provide much greater flexibility.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.805
This is the main benefit.

00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:15.905
With Google Analytics, we can define audiences based on any kind of behavior,

00:05:15.904 --> 00:05:19.819
original traffic source, or custom dimensions such as

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.019
loyalty level or back end lead qualification status.

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:29.629
The specificity we have in defining our remarketing audiences in Google Analytics is

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.360
a good reason to go this route instead of

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.740
using Google AdWords defined remarketing audiences.
