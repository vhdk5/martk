00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.134
As we begin to discuss user constituencies,

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:06.389
let's go back to the basic concept of segmentation.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.419
We've learned that segmentation provides focus.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:14.259
It surfaces important data points and it amplifies trends.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:20.030
Let's consider all of these points more closely in the context of user constituencies.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.420
Let's use Airbnb as an example.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.255
We don't actually have access to Airbnb's Google Analytics data,

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:29.299
but we're using the site because it attracts

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.520
two clearly defined constituencies: potential guests and potential hosts.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.609
Let's say that the two main goals on Airbnb are to list a room and to book a room.

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.619
Would it make sense for us as analysts to measure the performance

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.820
of listing a room for visitors who are there to book a room? Of course not.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.929
This is where segmentation for user constituencies comes in.

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.994
We want to analyze the right goals within meaningful segments.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:58.879
A segment that report for

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.005
the list room goal could look something like this in Google Analytics.

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:06.650
We see that there are the same number of goal completions for

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.960
the potential host segment and the all sessions segment.

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.214
But when we look at the conversion rate,

00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:20.060
we see that the conversion rate is much higher for potential host than for all sessions.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.275
That's because we've narrowed our focus.

00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:25.670
We have a smaller number of users in

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.195
the potential hosts segment than we do for all sessions,

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:32.764
so the conversion rate is actually much more meaningful.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:36.894
Similarly, if we chart goal conversion rate over time,

00:01:36.894 --> 00:01:40.819
there's much more amplitude within the potential host segment than for

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.114
all sessions because again we're dealing with a smaller number of users,

00:01:46.114 --> 00:01:49.369
so any changes will be more pronounced.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.490
Did the commission structure change that occurred in the middle of

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:56.045
January have a great impact on the list room goal?

00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:59.390
If we're looking at the orange line for all sessions,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.239
we only see a little bump,

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:04.969
but when we narrow our focus to the potential hosts segment,

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.295
we see that there was a sharp increase.

00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:11.500
How do we define these segments to map to our user constituencies?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.694
Often users' own behavior will be enough for us to create a segment.

00:02:16.694 --> 00:02:21.259
In other cases, we may be able to use a custom dimension that we've captured,

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:25.000
such as loyalty or a login status.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.895
Sometimes you may have a special segment of your traffic coming from a specific referral.

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:34.835
You can consider that to be one of your user constituencies.

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:37.570
In the case of Airbnb, what could we do?

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.745
Well, anyone interested in becoming a host

00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:43.969
would click become host and probably host a home.

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.020
Now, we have the information that we need to define the segment

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.610
because the user has sent a page with a path containing host homes.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.665
This will characterize the session.

00:02:54.664 --> 00:02:56.900
Let's see how we would define the segment.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.504
On the new segment screen,

00:02:58.504 --> 00:03:03.939
we could click conditions, page, contains, host/homes.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:08.585
Again, this page you as characterizing the entire session and it's pulling in

00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:13.625
every interaction that also happened in the session, including goal conversions.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.409
In fact, if we wanted to,

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.180
we could change the scope from sessions to users such

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.460
that any user whoever view the host homes page would be included in this segment.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.150
We can name the segment potential hosts and that's it.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.990
The segment won't necessarily be 100 percent accurate because there could

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.159
be potential guests who end up on the host homes page.

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.969
But is this segment still valid and will it help our analysis?

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:45.669
Absolutely. We want to work with the blue line and not the orange line.

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.704
That's the power of segmentation.

00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:51.850
So, think about who your user constituencies are.

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.150
They're not always clear immediately,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.569
and there may be some of us who have experiences

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.599
that are designed for just one general audience,

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.139
but many of us do have different user constituencies.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.654
As a high priority,

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:08.479
identify those constituencies and identify the piece of

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:13.639
data in Google Analytics that will allow you to define the constituencies.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.404
If you don't have that piece of data in GA,

00:04:17.404 --> 00:04:19.549
such as accustomed dimension value,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.240
make sure that you include that in your implementation plan.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.460
Once you do have these segments defined,

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:29.014
do most of your analysis with those segments applied.

00:04:29.014 --> 00:04:32.599
Most of the insights that we're looking for are a lot more

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.180
likely to come from segmentation than from aggregation.
