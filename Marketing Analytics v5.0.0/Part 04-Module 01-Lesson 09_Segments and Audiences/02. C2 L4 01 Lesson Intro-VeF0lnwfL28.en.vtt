00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
In this lesson, we explore the very important topic of Google Analytics segments.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.375
We'll learn how segments tighten our focus and amplify data points.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.740
We'll look at the built-in segments and then we'll get to the real power of segments,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.199
custom segments that we define ourselves.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.329
We'll talk about mapping segments in Google Analytics to your user constituencies.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.879
Similar to segments, we'll learn how to build audiences for re-marketing and testing.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:30.779
We will also touch upon dynamic re-marketing which in a sense is

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.049
hyper segmentation based on specific products or services that your users have seen.
