00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
There's one more nuance to consider when we look at conversion reports.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.929
Reports in Google Analytics use last click conversion attribution.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.129
That means that a conversion you see is attributed to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.140
the last channel the consumer interacted with before coming to your site.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.910
For instance, I see a user enter the site from a social channel,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.609
and in that session the user purchases.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.094
Google Analytics will attribute the conversion to the social channel.

00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:33.914
However, more often than not,

00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:37.490
that's not an accurate representation of what actually happens.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.310
Many times, more marketing channels are

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.640
responsible for the conversion that happens on your site.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.910
For example, the user may see a search ad,

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.279
click on it, and visit your site,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.965
but not buy anything then the user sees a display ad and visits again,

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:56.665
but still does not buy.

00:00:56.664 --> 00:01:01.070
Finally, the user sees a post on social channel for your product.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.170
Seeing the last post,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.835
the user decides to click on the link in the post and buy a product on your site.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:11.524
The last interaction was with a post on the social channel,

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:13.344
so Google will by default,

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:17.900
attribute to conversion to the social channel even though the search ad in

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.990
the display ad the user saw before had

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:24.920
an influence and helped the user decide to buy the product.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.329
Channels can play different roles in helping the conversion.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.265
There are three roles defined in Google Analytics: last interaction,

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:40.034
that's when the channel immediately precedes the conversion, and assist interaction.

00:01:40.034 --> 00:01:43.189
Any referral that's on the conversion path,

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.454
but it's not a last interaction.

00:01:45.454 --> 00:01:50.465
First interaction, that is the first referral on the conversion path.

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:53.390
The multi-channel reports allow you to take

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.055
a closer look at the different channels that leads to a conversion.

00:01:57.055 --> 00:01:59.810
The top conversion paths report shows all of

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.935
the unique sequences of channel interactions that led to conversions,

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:09.050
as well as the number of conversions from each path and the value of those conversions.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.680
The time lag report shows how many days passed between

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.004
the first interaction and last interaction for your users conversion paths.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:22.444
This can give you insight into the length of your online sales cycle.

00:02:22.444 --> 00:02:26.239
The path length report brace out your conversions by the number

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.350
of channel interactions contained in your user's conversion paths.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.439
This can tell you how many times a user typically returns to your site before converting.
