00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
We've seen the Goal Conversion Overview report,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.615
and we learned how to use Funnel Visualization reports.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:10.019
That gives us a good handle on the average conversions and

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.664
how people get through important steps leading up to the goals.

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:19.320
But a lot more can be learned when we start looking beyond our average or total audience.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.370
As a marketer, you will want to evaluate your data for certain segments

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.630
of your users or for the users who have shown particular behavior.

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:30.804
That's where the Goal Flow reports come in.

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:36.859
Let's first take a look at how we can read the information in the Goal Flow reports.

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.210
First, we see our funnel represented again for the checkout goal.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.195
You can toggle to different goals here.

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:48.454
The green boxes represent the different steps in the goal funnel.

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:51.949
You might notice that the numbers are slightly higher.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.750
In the Goal Visualization report,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.664
we were looking at sessions that had the different specified steps.

00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:03.259
Here we're looking at how often users view the pages that represent the different steps,

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:07.280
and it's possible for a user to view a page more than once in the session.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.609
For example, a user may decide to go back to the cart page to

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.269
check again what was in the cart after seeing the price.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:15.989
When you hover over the green boxes,

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:18.379
you see the information on exits again.

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:23.149
For instance, we see that after viewing the cart page in 43 percent of the cases,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.359
the billing and shipping page is seen next.

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:29.644
We can do the same for the other steps in the funnel.

00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:34.024
The red lines represent the number of next steps that are exits.

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:35.990
When you hover over the red lines,

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:38.405
you can see where people exit.

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:43.460
That information is all very similar to what we had already seen before.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.649
But in this report, it's possible to look at

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.890
this information while also considering other things.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.340
You can select what you want to look at specifically here.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.045
The default report shows us the steps taken by users

00:01:56.045 --> 00:02:00.454
depending on the source of the traffic or whether users were coming from.

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:04.534
But there are many other lenses to look at related to acquisition,

00:02:04.534 --> 00:02:07.534
behavior, and user characteristics.

00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:10.460
All the things we've discussed in the previous lessons.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.099
Let's select the source medium lends,

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.204
since we're interested in what marketing channels are working.

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:20.300
Once you select a lends like in this case the traffic source,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.045
the report gives you a bit more information.

00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:25.729
You can click on the traffic source link you're interested

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.669
in and inspect the goal flow like this.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:32.119
You can also get more information for a specific channel,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.860
by clicking on the channel.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.665
You can ask to just see this channel or you can ask for more information about it here.

00:02:39.664 --> 00:02:43.114
The numbers reported below are interesting as well.

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:45.844
They allow you to check the percentage of sessions that

00:02:45.844 --> 00:02:49.490
ultimately resulted in a purchase by source medium.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.590
In this example for instance,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.340
you see that of the sessions that started from organic search traffic,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.325
14 percent completed the purchase.

00:02:58.324 --> 00:03:03.604
Compare that to the 32 percent that converted from the male channel.

00:03:03.604 --> 00:03:08.269
This happens to be referral from male that's internally at Google.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.435
So we can expect us to be higher.

00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:14.000
Overall, this report allows you to get a good sense of how

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.715
different groups of users each with different characteristics convert for your goals.

00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:22.594
We've talked a lot about the purchase completed goal.

00:03:22.594 --> 00:03:25.819
Don't forget that there are other goals set up as well and you

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.180
can check how those are completed by different audiences too.
