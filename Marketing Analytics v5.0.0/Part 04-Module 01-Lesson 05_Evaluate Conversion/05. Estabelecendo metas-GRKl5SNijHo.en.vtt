00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.935
If you want to track conversions,

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.910
you need to tell Google Analytics what your goals are.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.990
You do that in the admin section of your Google Analytics account.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.265
Here, Google let's you specify your goals.

00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:15.044
Let's walk through one example of setting up a goal.

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:17.719
Of course, since there are different types of goals,

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:20.125
the set up will differ from goal to goal,

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:23.734
but this will help you to understand the underlying process.

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:25.484
If you want to learn more about this,

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:29.594
you can do so in a link that I've added in the notes below.

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:33.475
I'm going to walk through the set up of a goal for the Udacity website.

00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:38.219
As you may know, Udacity runs a nanodegree for self-driving car engineering.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.924
For this degree, interested students need to apply.

00:00:41.924 --> 00:00:44.585
It is our goal to get as many applications as possible,

00:00:44.585 --> 00:00:48.739
thus an application for this program is an important conversion for us.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.225
Let me show you how students might convert.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:54.730
They land on our home page, here,

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.164
and they may go into exploring our nanodegree programs.

00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:03.984
Here, they can find the self-driving car engineering nanodegree.

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:05.655
Then may click on that.

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:06.870
And once they're here,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.859
they find a little bit more information and may decide to apply now.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:16.620
They then have to fill out the application form and hit the submit button,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.060
which is here at the bottom.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.000
Then, they get this lovely page telling them their application was submitted.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.510
If I track how many people got to see this page,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.465
then I will know how many people converted and applied.

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:30.915
So, I can set this up as a destination goal in Google Analytics.

00:01:30.915 --> 00:01:34.859
And my destination is this exact page. With this URL.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.349
Let's see how that process works.

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.959
Goals are defined at the "View" level.

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:45.280
I'm here in the "All User Level" for the Udacity account.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.870
This is a view I've set up for walk-throughs like this one.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.910
I am in the "Admin" section here where I can select "Goals".

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.039
So let's set up a new goal.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.230
There are three big chunks in the process of setting up a goal.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.125
There is the general goal set up,

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:04.709
then there is the goal description and there are the goal details.

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.745
In the goal set up, I have the option to select a preset template,

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:11.240
or I can use a custom setup.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.090
There happens to be a template here that exactly describes my goal, submission.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.961
You see it's a template I can use for the submission of an application,

00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:22.795
so I'm going to select that.

00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:25.409
Then, I get to describe my goal.

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.030
I can give it a name so I will recognize later what this goal was all about.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.280
Let's call this one "Submission for the carND".

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.669
The goal gets assigned a number.

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.049
This is my second goal,

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.814
so this seems fine.

00:02:38.814 --> 00:02:40.590
Then I can choose the goal type.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.645
As we said this is a destination goal,

00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:44.760
because I ultimately want to monitor

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:48.560
how many people made it to my "Application Submitted" page.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.689
So, destination here is correct.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.389
Let me go to the next step then, the "Goal details".

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.769
Since this is destination goal,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.090
we have to tell Google Analytics what the destination is.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.140
In our case, the destination equals the following URL.

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.109
Note how I can drop the first part the URL, here.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.515
Google will still recognize it.

00:03:09.514 --> 00:03:12.750
Then we can assign a value to this URL.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.659
Well, hypothetically, let's say that ten percent of

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.060
the people that apply actually get started with the degree,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.435
and that the associated price is $800.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:26.330
Then, each application is worth eighty to us.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.015
Let's use that for the value.

00:03:28.014 --> 00:03:30.419
We can also describe the expected path that

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.144
we believe users will take to get to this goal.

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:34.840
That's called a funnel.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.164
You don't have to do that,

00:03:36.164 --> 00:03:38.984
but if you have a typical path that leads to this goal,

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:42.735
it can be interesting to tell Google Analytics what that path is.

00:03:42.735 --> 00:03:45.030
Then, Google Analytics can show you in

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.474
the reports where users get stuck in the path and leave.

00:03:48.474 --> 00:03:52.489
So, let's put in the typical path that we walked through.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.830
So, in order to get through the application process,

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.490
I'm assuming that most of my students are starting at

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.070
a nanodegree overview page. So, let's type that in.

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.280
This is the associated URL.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.205
And remember, I don't need that first part of the URL.

00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:10.880
Then Google asks me whether this page is required.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.055
And in this case, it's not really required to get on to the next step.

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:16.875
So, I'm going to leave this as "No".

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:20.199
Next stop is the carND page, and its URL.

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.094
And I remember this one was "drive".

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:28.320
Then the user comes to the application page and the associated URL.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.344
This one is a little bit more complex.

00:04:30.345 --> 00:04:32.840
And again, we don't need the first part.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:36.789
After this page, the user reaches the goal destination,

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.915
the applications submitted page.

00:04:38.915 --> 00:04:41.480
But that one we don't need to make part of the funnel

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.629
as it is already considered as the end destination.

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:47.740
So, now my goal is set up and I can save it.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.960
I will then be able to track this conversion in my Google Analytics reports.
