00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.104
This last quiz showed us how to combine

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:07.919
traffic acquisition reports with observations related to shopping behavior.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.419
As you've probably seen,

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:14.550
the acquisition reports and the behavior reports have conversion data built into them.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.099
Like in this channel report example,

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.129
you can use this report to see how many sessions from

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:23.129
a particular channel resulted in a transaction,

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.384
for instance, using the e-commerce conversion rate.

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:30.120
In this example, 0.07 percent of the traffic

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.064
coming in through social channels resulted in a transaction.

00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:38.129
This information is very important when trying to evaluate which

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.240
marketing channels are most likely to help towards your goals.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.910
It's important to use them to look beyond just generating traffic.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.329
In this example, I may be very proud of my accomplishments to

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.614
drive traffic to my sites using social channels,

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.300
however, it looks like that traffic is not really

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.704
helping me much towards my goal of selling products.

00:00:59.704 --> 00:01:03.619
I remember talking to a client once who was super excited about

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.614
a new Facebook campaign they had started to market their fashion app.

00:01:07.614 --> 00:01:10.519
They were a startup and they were of course focused on

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.489
getting as many app downloads as possible.

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:16.219
The Facebook campaign generated many clicks to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.670
the app website and the founders could not have been happier.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.670
This campaign made the search marketing campaign they

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.894
had been running for months look super small.

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:30.319
The search campaign had never generated this amount of traffic to their website.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.674
So, the company decided to shift the budget to the Facebook campaign.

00:01:34.674 --> 00:01:37.640
However, when we took a look at Google Analytics,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.549
we saw that Facebook campaign was indeed bringing

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.569
many visitors to the site but those visitors didn't convert,

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.589
only very few of them actually downloaded the app.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.500
The search campaign was not bringing in the user volumes we saw from

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.049
Facebook but the probability of those users converting was way higher.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.609
We calculated what the cost per downloads ended up

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.250
being for the people that were acquired via

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.950
search versus Facebook and it turned out that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.189
the downloads from Facebook cost the company twice as much,

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.764
all due to the facts the conversions did not happen.

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:12.554
When they got these insights,

00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:15.530
the founders decided to shift course and put the money

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.789
spent on the Facebook campaign into search marketing instead.

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:23.750
Acquisition should never be evaluated in isolation.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.784
You should always evaluate whether your acquired traffic actually converts.

00:02:28.784 --> 00:02:32.000
If not, you may be wasting your time and your money.
