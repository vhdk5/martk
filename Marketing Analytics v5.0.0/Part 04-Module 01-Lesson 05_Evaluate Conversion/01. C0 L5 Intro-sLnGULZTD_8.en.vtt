00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
Now, we will dig a bit deeper into evaluating whether

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:08.640
that behavior leads to conversions or user actions that are important to your business.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.280
Here is what you will learn in this lesson.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.320
A few basic definitions,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.644
setting up a goal in Google Analytics,

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:19.754
conversion reporting, evaluating conversion funnels,

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:22.949
using Google Analytics for e-commerce reporting,

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.099
evaluating shopping behavior, and evaluating

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.160
the influence of multiple channels in a conversion.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.809
So, let's take a look at

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.799
a few definitions that will come in handy as we go through this lesson.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.949
I put them all in one place next,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.280
but we will repeat the definitions as we go through the lesson.
