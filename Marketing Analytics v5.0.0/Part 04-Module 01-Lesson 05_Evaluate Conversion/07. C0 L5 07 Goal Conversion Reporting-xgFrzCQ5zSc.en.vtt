00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.209
Now that we know how goals are set up let's take a look at

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:07.575
the conversion reports associated with these goals in Google Analytics.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:10.890
Here's the conversion section in Google Analytics.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.605
Here we're looking at the overview report.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:17.129
This report provides us with the basic metrics.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:22.250
First, the total number of goal completions in the time frame we're looking at.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.355
So, that's the total number of conversions or the total number of

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:30.670
visitors who have completed all steps defined as part of this goal.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.905
We can also see the goal value here.

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:37.280
In the case of the Google merchandise store the goal value has

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.399
not been set because it's an e-commerce site.

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.274
The value information is all part of the commerce reports section we'll cover later.

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:48.530
The goal conversion rate is the percent of sessions

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.405
during the selected time period that resulted in a goal completion.

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:55.160
We can also see the abandonment rate.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.779
This is the total abandoned funnels divided by total goal starts.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.454
This applies for goals for which you have set up a funnel.

00:01:03.454 --> 00:01:05.239
Next to these overall metrics.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.989
You'll also see the total number of goal completions for your goals.

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:11.899
In the case of the merchandise store five goals have

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.109
been set up and these are their completion rates.

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:20.045
It looks like the engaged user goal is the one that is most often achieved.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:26.240
You can see all URLs that are a goal destination in the goal completion URLs here.

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:28.640
You can see it with their respective completions.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.700
You can also find the full report here.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.280
These URLs represent all the URLs where conversions take place based on the goals

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.950
you defined as well as the smart goals that Google

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.760
may have added if you're using Google AdWords.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.850
In the reverse goal path report you can get an idea of what the steps

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:51.929
were that a user took before getting to the goal completion location.
