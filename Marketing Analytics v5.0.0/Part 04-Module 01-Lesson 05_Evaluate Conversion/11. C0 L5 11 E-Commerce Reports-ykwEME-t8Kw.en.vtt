00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
The goal reports allow you to track and

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.674
evaluate the main overall conversions you're trying to achieve.

00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:08.865
Achieving a purchase can be a goal,

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:11.280
however goal reports do not give you

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.474
the detail behind the types of products that were purchased,

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:17.489
how many products were part of a transaction, et cetera.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:19.829
That's where the e-commerce reports come in.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.434
They allow you to get all the detail behind the shopping behavior on your site.

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:27.844
Before you can use the e-commerce reports on your site,

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:29.809
there are two things you need to do.

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:33.920
First, you need to enable e-commerce in your Google Analytics reports,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.140
and second you need to add specific code to your site or app to collect e-commerce data.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.480
You can choose to add e-commerce or

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:45.799
enhanced e-commerce tracking which will provide you more in-depth information.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.195
You can find the link below in the notes in the classroom.

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:53.795
Here you see the e-commerce overview report for the Google merchandise store.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:58.715
In this case, the enhanced e-commerce tracking and reporting is in use.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:02.035
The main metrics reported here are revenue,

00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:07.069
the total revenue from e-commerce transactions on your site or app.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:09.694
This can include the shipping rate and tax,

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.899
depending on how you've set it up.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.510
There's also the e-commerce conversion rate,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.085
which is the percent of sessions that resulted in an e-commerce transaction.

00:01:19.084 --> 00:01:24.229
There's the total number of transactions and the average order value.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.140
A part of this report provides information on

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.959
the marketing activity and the number of transactions,

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.094
and revenue that activity resulted in.

00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:36.114
This information relates to campaigns,

00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:39.634
for example AdWords or display campaigns that are running,

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:42.094
internal promotions you may be running,

00:01:42.094 --> 00:01:46.924
coupon codes you may have used or affiliate partners you may be working with.

00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:49.849
In order to track this marketing information,

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.449
all the marketing activity needs to be tagged properly.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.429
We mentioned this before,

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.760
if you want to see this information in Google Analytics,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.980
you have to provide Google Analytics with

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.549
the information that allows it to track incoming traffic,

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.169
and to classify it as traffic coming in from these marketing activities.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.250
You do this using UTM codes,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.370
you can find more information about those in the classroom notes.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.080
This report also has more information about the products you're selling on your site.
