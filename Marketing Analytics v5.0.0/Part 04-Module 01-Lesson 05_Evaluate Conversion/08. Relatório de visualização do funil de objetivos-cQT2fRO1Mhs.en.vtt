00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.110
Remember how you can put a funnel together when setting up a destination goal?

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.040
A funnel specifies different steps a user would

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.375
typically take to get to conversion for one of your goals.

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:13.980
Funnels are a very valuable tool when you have

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.875
a clear conversion path built into your site.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:21.730
For instance, in the case of the application goal for the Udacity [inaudible] program,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.745
where the goal is to get a student to fill out the application form.

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:29.760
Funnels are even more common in e-commerce.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.255
All e-commerce sites have a sales conversion goal.

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:38.675
And any sales process online involves a relatively similar checkout process.

00:00:38.674 --> 00:00:40.762
As an e-commerce site owner,

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:45.359
you need to make sure that the checkout process works very smoothly.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.841
Let's take a look at this video from Google.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:56.155
Hey. This all thanks.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:56.867
Are you sure?

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:57.789
Yeah.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:58.280
Username?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.219
Nick M?

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.089
No.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.288
NM1983?

00:01:01.287 --> 00:01:01.666
No.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:04.031
Zandi pops?

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:04.581
Sorry?

00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:06.489
Zandi pops.

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:08.500
No, okay. Don't worry, I'll help. What's your post code?

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.847
It's a GU749ZT.

00:01:11.847 --> 00:01:14.251
Welcome back Nick forever.

00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.000
Please listen carefully to this spreed licence agreement

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.150
before continue with your purchase of a loaf of bread.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.950
If you do not, blah blah, blah,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.960
you'll simply not use any bread paste product for

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:23.709
the purposes prohibited by an article you know including

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:25.419
without limitation designed development manufacturer of

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.070
missiles chemical nuclear or biological weapons.

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.339
Tick.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.698
I'm afraid you've timed out.

00:01:31.698 --> 00:01:39.213
What? Sorry, hello? Excuse. Oh. Yeah. Hey.

00:01:39.213 --> 00:01:40.379
Just one loaf sir?

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:41.514
Yeah.

00:01:41.513 --> 00:01:42.375
What's your username?

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:47.868
It's Nick forever but number four, not the.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:49.474
Got you. Okay

00:01:49.474 --> 00:01:51.359
I'm just going to check that you're a real person.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.189
Could you say that for me.

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.030
That's not even a word.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.890
Hey, how about this one?

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.784
You know what? Forget it.

00:01:55.784 --> 00:01:57.039
Well, this one?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.891
Hippopota mice.

00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:00.000
You're in.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.719
Great. I'm in.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.319
8.85 pounds.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.894
It's supposed to be 98 pounds.

00:02:02.894 --> 00:02:03.786
Plus express delivery.

00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:04.436
What's that?

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:05.754
Well, express delivery.

00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:11.280
It's fast but there's a standard.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.743
Standard?

00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:13.780
Standard delivery. That's 4.99 pounds.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.629
Why?

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.740
Bread insurance. You didn't untick to decline the bread insurance option.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.359
You know what, I think I'll risk it.

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.460
It is quite close to the sell by date.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.370
Don't care.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.740
98 pens it is. If you want to put back in

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.390
five business days, it will be ready for your collection.

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.119
Well, I need it now obviously.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.164
Oh, okay. You want the take home today price?

00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:31.030
Well, that's about 3.27 pounds.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.349
You know what? I'm going to go.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.509
Come back soon.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.530
I won't.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.560
The goal funnel visualization report

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.689
can help you to understand whether there are

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.169
parts of your check out funnel that could be improved.

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.319
Remember the funnel we looked at for the Google merchandise store,

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.814
associated with the purchase completed goal?

00:02:59.814 --> 00:03:03.340
This is how the funnel was set up in the admin section.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.420
Now we can go check the conversion data for the steps in the funnel,

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.224
in the funnel visualization report here.

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:15.144
This report gives you a visualization to help us understand where users drop out,

00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:17.650
and why the road blocks into check out may

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.375
not be near as bad as what we saw in the video.

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:25.120
This report can give you an indication of where there could be opportunity to improve.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.425
The funnel that was set up for the check out goal starts at a cart.

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:31.160
So, the ideaness that we're looking at

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.055
those users who have something in their shopping cart and we're

00:03:34.055 --> 00:03:39.550
now evaluating whether they get all the way through the funnel to ultimately checkout.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.250
You can start reading the report here on the left.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.685
This is where users enter the funnel.

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:49.750
In this case, there are 21,091 users that enter the funnel.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.375
These are the users on the shopping cart page.

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:54.955
We can see where these users come from,

00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:59.360
or which page they were on right before entering the funnel.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:08.965
Of the 21,091 users that started the funnel on the shopping cart page, 14,067 left.

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:11.000
These people dropped out of the funnel.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.939
That means they did not take the next step in the funnel as we defined it.

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.019
They're represented here in red.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.839
You can see where these people go next.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.879
A fair amount of them exit but not all of them do.

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:24.235
Some people go onto the sign in page,

00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:27.069
some go back to their baskets etc.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.219
So, it's possible that some of them will still come back and go through

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.680
the funnel but they're not doing it in a straight line that we had in mind.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.615
The customer journey is not linear,

00:04:35.615 --> 00:04:38.170
it's quite a windy road sometimes.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.905
7,024 people continue on to the billing and shipping page.

00:04:43.904 --> 00:04:47.814
That's 33.3 percent of the people that entered the funnel.

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:50.665
Again, of the people that land on this page,

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:54.710
some people leave the funnel as represented again by that red line.

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:58.719
Now, all the other steps are similar and at the end you can see that there's

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.890
3,806 people that made it and they completed the purchase.

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.240
That is about 18.05 percent funnel conversion rate, which means that,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.345
of the users that entered the funnel,

00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:14.785
18.05 percent made it all the way to my goal,

00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:17.225
in this case, a completed purchase.

00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:20.110
Well, you may wonder now what this really means.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.610
How good or bad is this conversion rate?

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.610
Well, unfortunately, having more than 80 percent of the users abandon

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.990
their shopping cart without purchasing is above the average abandonment rate,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.814
which is around 69 percent according to research from Baymard Institute.

00:05:35.814 --> 00:05:37.980
Yes, it is common for people to leave

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.189
their shopping cart and they state all kinds of reasons for that.

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:44.055
Things like, I was just browsing or window shopping,

00:05:44.055 --> 00:05:45.525
but I did not plan on buying,

00:05:45.524 --> 00:05:48.509
or the shipping costs were too high etc.

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.360
If you're interested, you can find the most common reasons in

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.715
a report from Statista referenced in the notes.

00:05:54.714 --> 00:05:58.889
Even though people abandon for different reasons and even though some of that is normal,

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.110
it's always worth it to evaluate the funnel and

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.095
assess whether there's anything you can do to improve.

00:06:04.095 --> 00:06:06.570
The Funnel Visualization report is helpful in

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.865
that process because it makes it easy to quickly spot where things are going wrong.

00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:13.305
In Google Merchandise check out example,

00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:16.879
it looks like most users were lost after the cart page.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:20.750
So here, and we can see where they exit to.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.125
It looks like many of them exit the site altogether.

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:27.274
Those could very well be the people that were window shopping.

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:31.319
But next up, we see that people leave for the sign in process.

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:33.209
Let's take a look at the checkout process to

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:36.539
figure out why people are leaving to sign in.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.180
In this example, I'm in the cart page,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.420
and I've put a few products in my cart.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.199
I then click on the next step by clicking checkout.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.159
And since I was not signed in,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.870
this is the next page I see.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.750
It looks like Google wants me to sign in first.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.290
Well, that's confusing.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.480
After I sign in,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.030
I land back in the shopping cart and I can complete my checkout.

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:00.834
So, clearly the sign in page was a blocker here.

00:07:00.834 --> 00:07:03.094
It's not clear why I'm asked to sign in

00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:05.940
and it may confuse people in the checkout process.

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:08.730
The last thing you want to do is put any kind of

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.055
obstacle in front of people when they're going through a checkout,

00:07:12.055 --> 00:07:16.334
as you may lose them altogether and it looks like this is what is happening in this case.

00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:19.949
It is true that these people may come back to the checkout process after

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:23.654
signing in but that's pretty unclear.

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:27.229
The Funnel Visualization helps us to see where the drop offs are happening.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.730
And with a little bit of investigation,

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.140
you may find ways to optimize and make the conversion rates better.
