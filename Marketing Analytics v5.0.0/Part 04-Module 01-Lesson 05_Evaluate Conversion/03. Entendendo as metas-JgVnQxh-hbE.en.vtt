00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.134
You've looked at where your users come from and how they behave on your site.

00:00:07.134 --> 00:00:09.410
But you may also have an action from the user in

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.464
mind that aligns with your business objectives.

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:17.009
In order to measure how well your site or app fulfills your objectives,

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.390
you can tell Google Analytics what ideal behavior looks

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.304
like on your site through the process of setting up goals.

00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:29.420
Goals are a way to track valuable actions you would like to see on your website.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.554
The goal is where you define the action you would like to see.

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:38.244
Completion of that valuable action itself is referred to as a conversion.

00:00:38.244 --> 00:00:41.699
Conversions could be things like a purchase,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.755
a download and an email subscription et cetera.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:49.039
So goals and conversions always go hand in hand.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.870
You count conversions and the goals are

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:56.184
a way to define what you will consider a conversion.

00:00:56.185 --> 00:00:59.960
Let's take a quick look at different types of companies and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.030
their objectives and the related Google Analytics goals.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.260
We talked about Betabrand before.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.160
One of the main objectives of their website is to sell products.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.325
So desired action on the website would be behavior that leads to a transaction.

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:18.755
In Betabrand's case, a goal in

00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:23.280
Google Analytics would just be a transaction or a product sale.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.835
BambooHR. is a B2B site.

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:29.069
They don't expect people to buy their product on the website,

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.349
but they want visitors to ask for more information.

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:37.655
So one of their goals could be to get people to fill out a request form for a live demo.

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:40.430
As you can see the nature of the goals differs

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.445
depending on the nature of the site and the objectives.

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:47.449
Typically goals fall into five types and in the next section,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.390
we will define what those five types are.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.765
But there's one more concept you need to understand when setting up goals.

00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:57.875
While you may have one big important goal in mind,

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:00.769
there are often several smaller steps a user

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:04.039
goes through before completing your big goal.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.980
We refer to them as micro goals.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.405
These micro goals are important smaller steps that lead to the bigger macro goal.

00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:15.275
When a micro goal is achieved we talk about

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:21.069
micro conversion and a macro goal relates to macro conversions.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.180
In the case of Betabrand for instance,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.082
the macro goal is to have users purchase a product,

00:02:27.082 --> 00:02:30.935
so a macro conversion would be a completed purchase.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:35.449
But there may be other micro goals that help to achieve this.

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:38.449
For instance Betabrand uses newsletters to let

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:42.129
potential customers know about new products or promotions.

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.889
These e-mails help to get users to come to the site and buy a product.

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.164
But in order for Betabrand to send these newsletters,

00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:53.074
they need users to sign up for them thus

00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:56.780
signing up for the newsletter could be considered a micro goal,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.120
because Betabrand assumes it will ultimately lead to the macro goal to purchase.
