00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
A large part of working with data is being able to

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.770
interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.960
To give you some practice with this,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.785
I've selected three Tableau dashboards for you to explore.

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:16.329
Choose one of these three dashboards,

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.275
whichever one interests you most,

00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:21.780
and find three insights in the visualizations.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.495
Write a short report explaining

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:26.880
each observation and how you found

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.865
the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard.

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:35.100
The first dashboard has population characteristics about the city of Madrid.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.755
It will interact with you as you scroll and click through it.

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:44.280
You can gain information about each specific part of the city in terms of births,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.470
deaths, and additional info.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.080
The second dashboard shows the impact of

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.850
malaria in different regions of Africa year-over-year.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.590
This, too, is interactive and allows you to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.785
view trends and the number of deaths for different regions.

00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:05.655
The final dashboard shows the top skills according to LinkedIn in 2016 for each country.

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:08.110
These skills are also ranked globally,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.040
where one is considered to be the best ranking.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.760
For your final project,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.350
you will be building dashboards just like these to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.280
share your insights about your own dataset.
