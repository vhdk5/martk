00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this section, we're going to meet a filtering challenge using regular expressions.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.240
This discussion is going to be fairly technical,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.359
but we'll cover the basics of regular expressions,

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.719
which is a skill that every GA professional should have.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.484
Regular expressions are used for advanced text matching,

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:25.155
and they themselves consist of text and special characters called metacharacters.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:28.500
Let's go back to the landing pages report and see

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.869
at least one case in which regular expressions are needed for filtering.

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:38.119
We see in row two of the landing pages report that the URL contains shop by brand.

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:42.890
If we wanted to see all of the landing pages that contained shop by brand,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.590
we may try to enter that into the basic filter field,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.540
shop plus by plus brand,

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.629
Enter, and the report zeros out.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.795
Why did that happen? That happened because

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:03.410
the basic filter field is actually interpreted as a regular expression,

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.700
and the plus character is a metacharacter that is not interpreted literally.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.079
This chart may look a little funny or even intimidating

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.170
if you haven't worked with regular expressions before.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.650
But this maps out the basic metacharacters that you would need for

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.955
regular expressions in most situations in Google Analytics.

00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:25.849
The good news is that a little bit of rejects goes

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:30.199
a very long way in GA. We see in row three that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.265
the plus symbol is actually a metacharacter that means match

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:39.019
any text string that has one or many of the proceeding character.

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:41.839
If we look at the last row of this table,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.225
we see the escape metacharacter.

00:01:44.224 --> 00:01:49.879
The escape metacharacter allows a metacharacter to be interpreted literally.

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:53.464
If we go back to the landing pages report and we add

00:01:53.465 --> 00:01:58.740
the escape character before the plus sign and we search again.

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.359
Now, we've successfully filtered by shop by brands because

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.659
the plus sign is not being interpreted as a metacharacter,

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.189
but as a literal character.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.979
Now in reality, we didn't actually have to use

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.250
a regular expression to filter by shop by brand.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.620
We could have applied an advanced filter.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.564
Include landing page contains shop by brand.

00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:27.650
In this case, this filter would not have been interpreted as a regular expression.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.000
So, we achieve the same filtering using an advanced filter.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.455
But let's consider another scenario where we have to use a regular expression.

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:38.955
Let's exit out this current filter,

00:02:38.955 --> 00:02:45.950
and let's say that we wanted to filter landing page by either apparel or accessories.

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.064
If we click into advanced,

00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:53.344
we see that there's and option to add conditions to an advanced filter.

00:02:53.344 --> 00:02:55.699
But there's no or option.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:03:00.394
So, what do we do? This is where regular expressions come in again.

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:02.689
If we look at the top of this table,

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.435
we see the pipe symbol as a metacharacter,

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:11.269
and if there's one metacharacter that we want to be familiar with in regular expressions,

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.480
it's the pipe symbol, the or symbol.

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:21.614
So, if we now enter a parallel pipe accessories into the filter field,

00:03:21.615 --> 00:03:24.830
we see that we have successfully filtered

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.730
the learning page primary dimension by either of these values.
