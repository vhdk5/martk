00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.325
In this section, we'll be talking about secondary dimensions, a straightforward,

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:10.980
critical and yet underutilized feature in GA. We always want to remember that

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.980
an important part of our role as analysts is to construct narratives to tell stories.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.289
The basic story that we're trying to tell is what's working and what's not.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.074
From there, we can hypothesize on what we can do to drive improvement.

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:30.899
In many cases, to tell a better story in our GA reports,

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.494
we want to apply secondary dimensions.

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:37.500
We can bring in other pieces of data relating to technology or

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.960
geography or acquisition to provide greater clarity.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.185
Let's take a look at the mobile overview report as an example.

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:50.540
We can see that there are big differences in bounce rate and especially in

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.820
e-commerce conversion rate between

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.994
the three-dimension values: desktop, mobile and tablet.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:59.689
As a basic optimization step,

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:05.359
I would want to see the end-user experience on these different device categories.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:07.730
But at this point, I still would not have

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.615
quite enough information to know which device category to pick up.

00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:16.750
The mobile overview report can be referred to as a low cardinality report,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.305
meaning that there are not a lot of different values for the primary dimension,

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:23.555
in this case, there are only three.

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:27.500
The benefit of a low cardinality report is that we don't have to deal

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.489
with a lot of different rows and the data is relatively aggregated.

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:34.009
The downside is that we don't always have

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.835
the necessary detail to make actionable observations.

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:40.369
Now we might say, "Let's go over to the mobile

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.475
devices report for more granular information."

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:45.079
That wasn't a bad idea,

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.799
but the problem is that for the time period selected,

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.834
there are over 3,600 different rows in this report.

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:55.219
This is a high-cardinality report,

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.670
meaning that there are many values for a single dimension.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.210
This can be useful when we need this level of granularity.

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.089
But sometimes it can be too detailed.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.505
So let's take another approach.

00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:10.219
We're going to go back to the mobile overview report.

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.400
We're going to apply a secondary dimension.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.510
If we click on secondary dimension,

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:17.989
we could take advantage of read-ahead to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.620
apply a secondary dimension that we already have in mind.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.205
Now what we're seeing is something that's quite surprising.

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:28.820
Before we apply the operating system as a secondary dimension,

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.819
it looked like the e-commerce conversion rate for

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.329
desktop as a device category was healthy across the board.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.680
But now we see that there's actually a stark difference between

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.550
e-commerce conversion rate for

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.050
Windows desktop and e-commerce conversion rate for Macintosh desktop.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.410
Let's look at secondary dimensions in the landing pages report.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.030
The landing pages report is already useful and that we can compare the different metrics

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.800
such as bounce rate and e-commerce conversion rate for the different landing pages.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.260
But here too, this report we'll become more

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.245
actionable when we apply a secondary dimension.

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:06.710
A natural marriage of secondary dimension with

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.290
the landing page is one of the acquisition dimensions such as source medium.

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:17.030
So we can see before we apply a secondary dimension that

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.479
the e-commerce conversion rate for the homepage as a landing page is 2.85 percent.

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:29.379
If we add source medium and filter for home as the primary dimension,

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.299
now we're telling a much richer story.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.120
We're seeing that the different sources of traffic that are

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.550
driving to the same homepage are

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.100
actually performing very differently in terms

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.204
of bounce rate and e-commerce conversion rate.

00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:47.090
We see that we potentially have the opportunity to drive more traffic to

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.670
the homepage from those sources that are generating a high e-commerce conversion rate.

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.949
On the other side of the coin,

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:59.250
we see that Google CPC as a source medium AdWords,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.229
driving to the homepage is not really showing an outstanding e-commerce conversion rate.
