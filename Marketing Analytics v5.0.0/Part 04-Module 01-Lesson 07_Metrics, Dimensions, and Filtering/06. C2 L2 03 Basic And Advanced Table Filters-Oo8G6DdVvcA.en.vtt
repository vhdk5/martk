00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.594
In this section, we'll be discussing the many uses of advanced table filters.

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:07.439
Before we get started,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.460
let's make sure to distinguish between table filters and view filters.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.589
View filters are configured in the view by an editor and are applied at processing time.

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.530
Typical view filters are configured to exclude

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.120
internal IP addresses and to lowercase dimensions such as page,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.955
campaign dimensions and event dimensions.

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:30.539
We'll be diving into view filters later in this course.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.625
In this section, we'll be focusing on dynamically applied table filters.

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:41.325
Let's first consider a basic filter that applies to the primary dimension in a report.

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:45.350
We're back on the landing pages report of the Google merchandise store account.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.820
If we wanted to filter all landing pages that contain a pay roll as an example,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.039
all we would need to do would be to apply a basic filter.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.504
So, we see that this basic filter field has filtered the report by the primary dimension.

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:07.850
Let's now again apply source medium as a secondary dimension to our landing pages report.

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:10.759
First, we'll just get rid of the current filter,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.030
source medium and we see in row nine Google CPC as one of the source medium values.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.644
Let's say that we now wanted to filter this report by source medium containing CPC.

00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:27.170
If we enter CPC into the basic filter field,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.075
the report zeros out.

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:33.770
This is because the basic filter only applies to the primary dimension.

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:37.689
In this case, we're trying to apply the filter to the secondary dimension.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.075
So, we're going to need to use an advanced filter.

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:43.519
Advanced table filters provide a lot of

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:46.685
additional functionality beyond basic table filters.

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:51.275
We can still filter by primary dimension in an advanced table filter,

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:54.955
but importantly we can also filter by secondary dimension.

00:01:54.954 --> 00:02:02.030
We'll also see that we can use different match types exact, starts ends, contains.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.825
We'll also be able to filter the report by metrics.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:09.229
We'll be able to apply multiple conditions and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.754
we'll also be able to use an exclude table filter.

00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:15.859
Lets ask out this basic table filter for now.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.630
Click into advanced.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:23.125
Now we see we have the choice of either dimension that appears in the table.

00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:29.115
We'll select source medium, containing CPC, apply.

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:34.715
Now, we've successfully filtered by source medium with the value containing CPC.

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:36.909
Let's remove this filter for now.

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.585
Let's see how we could filter the report by metric.

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:42.715
Click back into advanced.

00:02:42.715 --> 00:02:50.784
Let's say, include bounce rate greater than 50 percent, apply.

00:02:50.784 --> 00:02:55.944
Now we see that we've filtered our table by a specific threshold for bounce rate.

00:02:55.944 --> 00:03:00.414
If we wanted to add multiple conditions to the filter we could do that as well.

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:04.449
If we edit the current filter, we'll say,

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:09.389
landing page containing accessories.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.359
Now, we're filtering by landing page containing accessories

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.890
and also the bounce rate threshold of higher than 50 percent.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.299
Let's remove this filter for now.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.035
Let's apply an exclude filter.

00:03:23.034 --> 00:03:27.715
Let's take a little preview right now of the comparison display.

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:29.724
As the comparison metric,

00:03:29.724 --> 00:03:32.495
let's select e-commerce conversion rate.

00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:35.539
E-commerce conversion rate in the landing pages report

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:40.819
represents the conversion rate for sessions that began on these landing pages.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.594
We see that there's some pages that may be skewing this report.

00:03:45.594 --> 00:03:46.919
We see for instance,

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.009
that basket that HTML is showing

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.094
a 625 percent higher than average e-commerce conversion rate.

00:03:54.094 --> 00:03:59.889
If we want to exclude this page as an outlier and recalibrate the comparison display,

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.479
we can use an advanced table filter.

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.244
We'll say exclude landing page,

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:10.039
exactly matching, basket that HTML.

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:16.449
Now, the comparison has been recalculated with basket that HTML excluded.
