Now that we understands the difference data display options in Google Analytics,

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:07.830
let's take a step back and take a closer look at

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.085
the core building blocks of the Google Analytics tool.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:14.295
Once your data starts flowing into your account,

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:16.199
Google processes the data,

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.539
organizing them along dimensions,

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.804
and reporting them in metrics.

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:25.064
In this lesson, you'll learn more about these dimensions and metrics,

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:29.685
and different ways you can filter your data into Google Analytics reports.

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:31.209
Let's get started.
