00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
In this lesson, we'll take a close look at the dimension values that are sent in

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.810
Google Analytics hits and the metrics that are

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.214
calculated in the Google Analytics processing phase.

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:13.589
We'll also review advanced table filters,

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.350
and we'll see how the secondary dimension feature

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.755
can help our reports reveal more meaningful stories.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:21.824
As a specialized topic,

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:25.949
we'll see several use cases for essential regular expressions,

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.140
or regex, for advanced text matching with NGA.
