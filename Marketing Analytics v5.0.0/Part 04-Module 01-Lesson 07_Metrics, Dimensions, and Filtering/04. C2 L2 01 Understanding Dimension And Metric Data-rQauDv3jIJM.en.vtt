00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019
Let's go back for a second to the Pageview hit concept that we first

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.085
looked at when we were discussing custom dimensions in the last course.

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:10.320
When we send a page view to GA,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.109
we're sending many different types of fields.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.050
When we send an event hit to GA,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.574
were sending all the same fields as we sent in a Pageview hit,

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:24.494
plus event category, event action and usually event label.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:28.575
Most dimensions in GA are directly mapped from fields in the hit.

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:32.939
Examples of these dimensions are Page, Operating System,

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:38.015
Medium, Event Category and many others that come directly from the hit.

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:42.835
These dimensions appear as the attributes that organized most reports in GA.

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:47.495
Some of the other dimensions in GA are processed from other fields in the hit.

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:50.899
As examples, GA takes the IP address that is

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.185
sent in the hit and derives all of the GA dimensions.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:58.775
GA takes medium and source from the HIT and generates channel dimensions.

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:02.989
The device category dimension is mapped from mobile device branding,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.799
screen size, operating system and other dimensions that are sent in the hit.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.439
The landing page and exit page primary dimensions in

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.030
those reports are derived from the page fields sent to GA in the hit.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.445
During the processing phase,

00:01:19.444 --> 00:01:24.034
GA also calculates metrics to answer questions at different scopes.

00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:31.450
Examples of hits scope metrics for the page include Pageviews and average Time on Page.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.704
If we're talking about Hit Scope for events,

00:01:34.704 --> 00:01:38.125
a metric that's calculated is Total Events.

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:40.549
How many times was our video played?

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.879
How many times did a user click an off-site link?

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:46.849
Many of our metrics are calculated at Session Scope,

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:48.679
starting with individual hits.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.975
What was the Average Session Duration?

00:01:50.974 --> 00:01:53.299
What was the Goal Conversion Rate?

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.594
What was the Ecommerce Revenue?

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:59.379
Finally, we have metrics calculated at User Scope.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.089
Most notably the user's metric.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.105
GA can sometimes take the same data points

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:08.855
and process them as both metrics and dimensions.

00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:12.329
For instance, we see here on Audience Overview,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.695
Number of Sessions per User appearing as a metric.

00:02:15.694 --> 00:02:19.664
If we navigate down to the Frequency and Recency report,

00:02:19.664 --> 00:02:23.435
we see that same data used as a dimension,

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:27.140
Count of Sessions with the number of Sessions and the number of

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.504
Pageviews at each session count appearing within the report.

00:02:31.504 --> 00:02:35.264
As we proceed through the additional reporting features in the next sections,

00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:38.269
it will be useful to stay aware of dimensions and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.800
metrics as the most fundamental concept in Google Analytics reporting.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.160
Also know that the timeframe we have selected in

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.884
the Google Merchandise Store demo account is January 1st to March 31st, 2018.

00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:54.133
So, when you're going through these reports,

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:57.979
you can align the metrics with those that you're seeing in this lesson.
