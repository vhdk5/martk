Now we are going to put that learning to practice with an Ecommerce data set provided below.\n \nFor the purpose of this project, pretend you are a marketing analyst consultant and your client is an ecommerce website that sells sells unique all-occasion gifts. The client wants to make sure it understands their data. They are relying on you to help understand their data to inform their decision making. They’ve asked you to have a look at their sales history and provide some insights. \n* **Step 1**: Have a look over the data and decide on a question or questions to explore. Here are a few options you may consider:\n   * What product or products sold the best?\n   * What product or products might they want to discontinue selling?\n   * Was there any data that suggested seasonality? \n* **Step 2**: Using the ecommerce data set provided below, explore the data in Excel or Google Sheets, and create a visual story using a graph that answers the question(s) you’ve selected to answer. \n\n [Ecommerce Data Set](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12EPcAufhey6m0AmQ1nB4f5X1MaDdm81GAeKvCV16Dis/edit?usp=sharing) from an actual UK retailer. The data you will be using is a sample set derived from the Kaggle. *\"This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.\"* For more information on this data set you can visit the Kaggle repository [here](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data/home).\n \n* **Step 3**: Take a screenshot of your graph and any supporting information that is part of your story and submit your Story as a PDF for review.",
