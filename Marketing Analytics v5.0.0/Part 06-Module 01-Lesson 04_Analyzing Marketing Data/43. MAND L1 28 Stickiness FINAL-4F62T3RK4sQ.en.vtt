00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.520
Stickiness of a website or online app involves using

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.855
the monthly active users and daily active user count together.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:16.050
The ratio of the daily active users compared to

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.200
the monthly active users is called stickiness.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.090
The stickiness ratio is a very useful tool for several stakeholders,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.900
such as investors to know if a website or app

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.445
has a potential for growth or even the trajectory for growth.

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:35.450
Essentially, stickiness tells us if

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.880
the customers are coming back to the website or app every day,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.385
or are they sticking around to actually engage with it.

00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:49.520
So, a DAU by MAU ratio of 0.5 indicates

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.240
that the average user is engaged or using the app 15 out of 30 days that month.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.995
The common benchmark for social networking sites is 0.5,

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:04.250
while for gaming apps it is 0.1 to 0.2.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.865
But most other apps strive to achieve a stickiness ratio of 0.2.

00:01:09.865 --> 00:01:11.880
So, why is stickiness important?

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.650
It is a useful KPI for management and investors.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.200
Investors want to know if this app or website

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.395
has the potential to make money in the future.

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:25.880
For example, if the plan is to introduce advertising into the app,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.925
the potential evaluation will depend on whether the app

00:01:28.925 --> 00:01:32.525
has a large number of users that keep coming back to it.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.300
In other words, they need to know the number of

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.420
active users will likely increase over time.
