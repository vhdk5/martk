00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
So to calculate the average time to close a deal,

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:03.900
we follow two steps.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.089
First, we're going to go ahead and calculate

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.894
the total number of days for all sales combined.

00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:10.980
So, we have our four accounts here,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.060
and each of these numbers tells you the number of days from

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.054
first contact by the sales team member to closing the deal with Costco.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:24.855
So, for instance, this one took 150 days,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:26.730
so approximately five months.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.910
This one took six months and so on and so forth.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.200
So, we add these up so that this just be the sum of these days for each of your accounts.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.165
We got 720.

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:42.524
Number of accounts is just these accounts that we have,

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:45.369
and so I could just hard code for in here,

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:47.509
but I just want to show you a little trick.

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:49.549
So, if you do COUNTA,

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.375
it tells you if they're not empty.

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:56.060
You can actually just select the cells you want

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.975
and it will give you the count because these are the number of rows that I'm counting.

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:01.895
To get the average time to close,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.659
you just take the total number of days you took

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.994
for all the sales combined divided by the number of accounts,

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:12.140
and that gives you a 180 days.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.329
So on average, it took a 180 days to close the deals in this dataset.
