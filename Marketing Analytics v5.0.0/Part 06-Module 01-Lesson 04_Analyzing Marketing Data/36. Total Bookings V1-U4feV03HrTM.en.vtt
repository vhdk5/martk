00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.049
So here, we have an example of the car sales bookings.

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.585
You see the list of grocery stores in the first column.

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:11.609
Column B through E are the bookings for the last quarter of the year.

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:13.664
To get the total bookings,

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:17.759
all we have to do is actually just add up this amount and you can use

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.410
the sum function or can just type it in yourself here.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.350
All we do is here, add up these,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.535
and that gives you the total bookings for each of the months.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:30.809
Just a little side note,

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.699
so these are bookings for each of the stores.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.830
So, that means is that they'd been able to get

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.534
monthly or annual subscriptions to the customers.

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:46.265
It's that value of the subscriptions that is reflected in these.

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:49.549
So, these are the new bookings that they got every month.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.649
You can see that there are some cells which are empty.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.030
For example here, Sprouts is actually annual bookings.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.785
Once they have that then,

00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:01.250
they don't have any follow-up in November and December.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.950
So, that's what's being reflected here, okay?

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.799
See you in the next video.
