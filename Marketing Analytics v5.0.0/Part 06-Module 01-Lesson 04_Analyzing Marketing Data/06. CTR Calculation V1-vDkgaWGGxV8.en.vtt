Here's an example spreadsheet with some metadata for a website WeCart.

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:09.224
So, it looks like at WeCart we created ads and marketed them on Facebook,

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:11.490
Google Search, and Google Display.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.789
To calculate the click-through rate or CTR,

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.449
we include formula in this column for CTR.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.214
I've placed the equation here so you can see what I'm doing.

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:24.989
I'm going to put it in the first cell.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.009
So, this will be number of clicks over the number of

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.250
impressions or the number of people who saw this times a 100.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.079
That gives us the rate in percentage.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.479
You copy down the formula and I'm going to just reduce the number

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:46.244
of decimals to make it consistent and there we have it.

00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:51.239
In general, a two percent CTR is good but the average ranging from

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.579
1.9 2.35 but it varies widely by industry.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.799
