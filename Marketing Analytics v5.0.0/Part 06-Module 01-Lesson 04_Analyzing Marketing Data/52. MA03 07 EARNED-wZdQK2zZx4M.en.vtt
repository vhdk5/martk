00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
Thanks to the growth of social media platforms and

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.514
the emerging popularity of following influencers and bloggers,

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:10.394
earned media is incredibly important.

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:14.879
Now by definition, earned media is something generated by word of mouth,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.300
buzz, or a communication going viral.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.560
With earned, we have a whole new model by which we

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:24.934
evaluate data and that's through engagement.

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:27.469
We look beyond focusing on clicks,

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:30.379
advertising impressions or website views.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:33.289
With earned media, we collect data and

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.049
gather insights just as we do with our other channels,

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:39.829
but the earned media story is often best told when you

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.359
tie these insights into that data that you've collected with your other channels.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.000
When we measure and review our earned channels,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.354
we want to think of it as an additive fashion.

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:51.059
As we add more data,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.765
we reveal a bigger piece of the picture.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.674
At a high level, we typically set out to answer

00:00:56.674 --> 00:01:00.214
the following questions in the earned media space.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:04.609
For starters, what conversations are taking place about my brand?

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:06.620
This is where we looked at tools to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.310
evaluate all of the brand listening that you can be doing.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.519
What about topics or themes that are being most talked about?

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:19.834
This can help us evaluate trends and how people are tying our brand to those trends.

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:24.034
Who's my audience? These are all of the folks that are talking about you.

00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:28.474
Again, you can use that audience acronym that we reviewed earlier for this.

00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:32.044
All of those same analytical questions apply here.

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:36.185
Let's consider a few avenues of earned that we might want to measure.

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:40.174
Let's say we received a mention on a blog article or

00:01:40.174 --> 00:01:44.840
someone posted a tweet with a picture of our product., where can we start?

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.885
With the blog article,

00:01:46.885 --> 00:01:50.945
we care to understand where was it written, who was it written by,

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:54.875
why did they write it, did we get any benefit out of this,

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.540
did they link back to us,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.415
did we see any referral traffic, how much?

00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:02.790
Now, what about that tweet?

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.300
This one's a little more difficult because it's

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.659
a conversation happening completely outside of us.

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:13.294
So for starters, we might be curious if it spurred any other conversations.

00:02:13.294 --> 00:02:16.579
We also might want to see how influential this person is,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.430
or perhaps we can use the opportunity to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.885
investigate that person's individual interests to see what data we can glean.

00:02:24.884 --> 00:02:30.875
Moving on, we also care about metrics such as our share of voice,

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:35.134
the sentiment and our voice of the customer.

00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:40.609
Now, these are all avenues we explored when we review the tools available to us.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.895
As we move on, we'll look at the ways that we can capture

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:47.450
insights in regards to our brand for mentions,

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:52.250
share of voice, and we'll look at how we can evaluate conversations happening on Reddit,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.629
Linkedin, Quora and more.
