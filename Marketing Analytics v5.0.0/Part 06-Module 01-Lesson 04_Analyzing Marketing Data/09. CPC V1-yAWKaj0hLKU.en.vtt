00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
This spreadsheet has marked data for a website week card.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:05.025
The purpose of this example,

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:08.233
we created ads and marketed them on Facebook,

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:10.800
Google Search, and Google Display.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.960
You will use a formula to calculate the cost per click or CPC.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.275
So, I'm going to go ahead and create a row with that.

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:23.189
I've put the formula here so you can see how I'm calculating this.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.325
So, this will be the amount of money that we spend

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:31.004
on Facebook over the amount of clicks that we got.

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:34.710
So, we did C3 over C4,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.855
which is the amount of money spent on the ad over the number of clicks that we got.

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:41.789
As you can see in this example,

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:48.274
Google Search and Google Display give us about a dollar of CPC.

00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:51.799
In comparison, Facebook is more than $2.

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.994
Turns out $2 is the average CPC across all industries.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:01:00.979
Again, under this, you want to compare your CPC rates to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.619
your industry-specific averages to get

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.000
a better gauge of how your ad is performing on each platform.
