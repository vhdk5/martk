00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
In this lesson we went hands-on with

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.525
an incredible number of valuable and important metrics.

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:09.030
We studied the common data that we capture in

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.494
our paid owned and earned channels. With paid?

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:14.910
We talked through how paid advertising works

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.414
and looked at how we calculate click-through rate,

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:19.799
cost per click, cost per lead,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.664
cost per acquisition and our lifetime value.

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:27.549
We also looked at specific platforms such as Facebook and Google ads to see

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.760
where we can grab this data and how we can

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.670
turn it into meaningful and actionable insights?

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.644
We worked through the own channels studying how to evaluate our website,

00:00:36.643 --> 00:00:39.449
blogs, e-mails and our SEO.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.460
We also looked deeper at our sales metrics,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.245
growth metrics and those engagement metrics.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:49.354
We even had the opportunity to calculate stickiness and churn rate.

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:53.184
We closed out our time together by looking at the earn channels.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:58.204
Here, we saw how word of mouth and mentions contribute to the growth of our business.

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:01.339
We looked at ways to monitor and measure mentions,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.700
run share of voice surveys and how to gather insights out of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.060
popular platforms such as LinkedIn and ReadIt.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.090
I encourage you to continue practicing these skills by

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.418
exploring all the data-sets that you've seen in your free time,

00:01:14.418 --> 00:01:17.149
and using the frameworks and questions we learned earlier in

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.940
this program to generate meaningful insights.
