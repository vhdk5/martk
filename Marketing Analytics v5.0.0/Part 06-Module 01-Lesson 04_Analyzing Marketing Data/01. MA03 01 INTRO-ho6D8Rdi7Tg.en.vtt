00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
At this stage, we're ready to take a closer look at the questions we want to be

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.870
answering across all three areas of our marketing: paid, owned, and earned.

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.854
In this lesson, we're going to spend a lot more time

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.975
arriving at more questions that we can be asking,

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.239
the key data that we should be tracking,

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:21.139
and how we can apply all of these insights.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.760
We'll also put our skills into practice as we work

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.655
together to calculate these common metrics.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:28.199
Throughout our time together,

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.380
we'll also go hands-on as we explore where and how to

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.769
collect this data from a variety of platforms. Let's get started.
