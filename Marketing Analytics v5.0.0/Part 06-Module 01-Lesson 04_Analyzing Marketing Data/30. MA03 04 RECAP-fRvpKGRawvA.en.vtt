00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
Let's take a moment to reflect on what we've learned so far.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.759
We looked at the landscape of paid media,

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.349
and the various ways we'll be expected to analyze and report on our paid efforts.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.750
We also explored a number of calculations,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.464
including click-through rate, cost-per-click,

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:18.434
cost per lead, customer acquisition cost,

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:24.009
cost per acquisition, and customer lifetime value. Let's keep going.
