00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.854
So, to get the average deal size for all the accounts,

00:00:03.854 --> 00:00:07.559
I've set up a spreadsheet so that we can first calculate

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.280
the total bookings in dollars that we already did in the past,

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.289
in the previous video and then the number of deals for each of the accounts,

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.519
and then we're going to go ahead and calculate the average deal size.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.780
So first, we're going to go ahead and

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.905
calculate the sum of the bookings for each of these accounts.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:27.615
I'll just copy and paste it down,

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:30.989
and then the short number of deals where each of the accounts and then again,

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.434
I'm going to just copy this formula down.

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:34.950
I'm going to go ahead and copy these.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.050
So, I'm going to just go ahead and copy and paste the values,

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:42.359
copy and paste the values,

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.560
and then to get the average deal size that we got from each of

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.900
the accounts all you have to do is you divide the total bookings by the number of deals,

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.989
and that tells you the average amount for

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.780
each deal or that we got from each of these accounts.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.655
Right away, we can see,

00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:05.629
Sam's Club had really high bookings that it seems to me there was a mix of

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:10.759
monthly and annual subscriptions that we got and the reason is because we know that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.160
the monthly subscription is $16 and you're yearly subscriptions are $195.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.075
So, with that knowledge in mind,

00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:21.769
we can see that this- the amount that we got from Sam's Club and

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:26.364
Costco was a combination of monthly and yearly accounts, purely orders.

00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:28.819
So, the average deal size tells us that.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.304
We got a combination of monthly and yearly subscription from Costco and Sam's Club.

00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:36.030
Case of Sprouts, the book yield was smaller,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.070
but the booking size was bigger,

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.669
and that's because the average deal size

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.820
was a 195 which turns out to be a yearly subscription.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.659
So, all of the a 150 deals that we got for Sprouts, for this account,

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.200
were all annual versus in Safeway

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.630
where even though we've gotten the more number of deals,

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:58.579
the unit price was $16 which happens to be a monthly subscription.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.420
So, we didn't get as much bookings for that.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.329
But this kind of analysis allows the sales team to see okay,

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.180
which account is actually generating more bookings for them and focus their efforts

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.330
on the type of deals that they get and the type of customer that they're getting.
