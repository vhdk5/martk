00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.649
So, to calculate your growth metrics,

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.214
you would actually get the data from your data team.

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:06.240
So, for daily active users,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.929
this would be the number of users who were active in the particular 24-hour time window,

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.394
and the particular 24-hour time window is defined by the date you give the data team.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.074
For monthly active users,

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:27.600
that would be the number of users who were active within the month-long time window.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.270
So, let's assume for our mock data we have here,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.785
we have the daily active users provided based on the last day of each month,

00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:40.559
and the monthly active users is building off of that.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.730
So, for the whole month,

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:44.959
give us the number of users who were active.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.969
I created the bar graphs here to depict the numbers we had up here,

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.554
and you can see that there is a dip in the number of

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:59.000
active users on October 30th compared to September 30th,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.850
but it steadily improves after that.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.370
But the monthly active users count,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.125
which is the number of users who were active in the last month, were steadily increasing.

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:13.049
A better interpretation of the DAU and monthly

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.189
active user metric is using the stickiness ratio.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.605
So, let's go ahead and calculate the stickiness.

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:20.525
I'm using the formula provided here,

00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:22.840
and I'm using it for all of the months.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.719
So, this would be daily active users over monthly active users,

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.140
and I have a graph that I will go over in a minute.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.314
So now, we have the stickiness ratio calculated here.

00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:39.649
A stickiness ratio of one means that every user who visited the website in

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.650
the last month was also active on

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.830
the day on which the daily active user account was generated.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:52.579
You can see here that our stickiness ratio range between 0.1 to 0.21.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.329
This is the proportion of monthly active users who

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.189
came back to your product in that 24-hour or day window.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.209
So, 0.2 ratio means 20 percent of the month.

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.299
So six days out of the last month,

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.204
the user was back online looking at the website or app.

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:12.525
If you're ratio is say 0.01,

00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:13.830
that's less than a day,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.375
and that's a problem scenario.

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:19.099
So, engagement metrics are useful metrics to gauge how

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.284
often your website is being used and a good guide for your business.

00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:25.750
This line chart is a visualization tool

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.909
business analysts use to show the stickiness ratio.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.579
It can be used to show email campaigns or

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.870
experiments when your website features were introduced.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.335
They coincide with high or low stickiness ratio and

00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:44.070
can help guide future plans to introduce or revisit specific effort.
