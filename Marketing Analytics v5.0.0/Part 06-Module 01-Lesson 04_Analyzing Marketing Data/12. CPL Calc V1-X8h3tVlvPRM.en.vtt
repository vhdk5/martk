00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.189
Let's do it on our previous spreadsheet.

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:05.640
So, now we're going to go ahead and calculate the cost per lead.

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.349
To calculate the cost per need,

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:09.554
we need the total number of leads,

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:11.580
that were generated from an ad.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.640
So, I've created a row for total leads,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.670
and indicated the number of leads we got from each of these three platforms and displays.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.300
Next, calculate the cost per lead or CPL,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.050
I'm going to go ahead and put the formula for one copy and copy at the rest.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.339
So, this is going to be,

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.530
the cost for the ad again over the number of leads,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.000
and I'm going to go ahead and copy the formula over for the other three.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.460
So, as we can see,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.745
Google Search and Google Display cost us between $45 and $48 to get each lead.

00:00:47.744 --> 00:00:51.784
In comparison to Facebook's almost $94,

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.529
it's more expensive to create a lead there based on the ads.
