00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.314
This far, we've been focusing on the conversion metrics within our marketing metrics.

00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:13.439
However, you can also capture the impact of marketing campaign

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:18.344
in terms of revenue using metrics that capture the financial cost.

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:22.875
These include cost per acquisition and lifetime values.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:25.859
Let's tackle cost per acquisition first.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.599
Before we get started,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.915
acquisition refers to a non paying customer.

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:35.670
Cost per acquisition focuses on the sales and marketing cost,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.588
including cost of supplies,

00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:40.519
labor and marketing, overhead and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.800
sales that it took to convert a non paying customer into a paying customer.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.349
You calculate it by dividing the marketing and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.829
sales cost by the number of new lead customers.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.399
If you're feeling confused about CPA and CAC at this point,

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.664
don't worry, it confuse me to.

00:00:57.664 --> 00:00:59.960
Let's go over the difference between these.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.500
CPA is focused on the marketing and sales cost,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.394
so it includes overhead and salaries for staff in addition to marketing and sales costs.

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:13.204
CPA also focuses on sales leads,

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:16.109
not actual paying customers.
