00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
Now, let's do a calculation for the cost per acquisition.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:08.100
You may recall seeing a similar spreadsheet for CAC.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.414
But notice, here we're talking about leads.

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:13.064
In the CAC video,

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:15.390
you saw a number of paid customers.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.710
So, that is a difference between CPA and and CAC.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.515
The other thing I want to cover is how do I get the number of leads?

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:25.859
So, I actually got this from a spreadsheet where I was

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.414
tracking the number of leads from all the various platforms,

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:33.119
and so for say the number of leads for August,

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:37.259
I just added these up across the various platforms,

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:40.094
and that's how I arrived at the 191 number,

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:44.479
and so I repeat this process for each of the months and I input here.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.164
So, to calculate the cost per acquisition,

00:00:47.164 --> 00:00:49.924
remember these are the non-paying customers.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:54.239
You just take the total sales and marketing costs,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.620
so that's marketing costs,

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.309
sales and marketing salaries,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.400
and overhead costs divided by the number of leads.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.420
So, this will be this value over the number of leads,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.670
and that gives you the cost per acquisition or the amount of money you

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.469
spend on acquiring a customer that may turn into a lead.
