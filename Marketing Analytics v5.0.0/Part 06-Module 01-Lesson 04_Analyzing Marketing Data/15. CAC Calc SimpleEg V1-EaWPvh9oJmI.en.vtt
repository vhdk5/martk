00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.544
Here, you can see a slightly different spreadsheet,

00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:04.919
but it's actually building on the previous example.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:07.214
In row one, marketing costs,

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:09.615
and including the cost of building,

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.370
the ads across the street,

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.904
ad platforms from our previous examples.

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:17.609
Then, I've added in the sales and marketing salaries,

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.489
and included any overhead costs for sales and marketing.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.739
So, these show up in these three rows.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.399
We add them up to get our total sales and marketing cost.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.954
So, I'm going to sum up these three cell values,

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:34.979
and I'm going to copy the formula over for the other two months, September and October.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:38.489
Then, to get the customer acquisition cost,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.265
I'm going to take this total sales and marketing cost

00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:44.810
and divide it by the number of paid customer.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.420
So, I'm going to get back in that formula.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.145
So, I'm going to take this,

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:53.035
divide it by the number of paid customers,

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:58.469
and copy the formula over again for the two months remaining, September and October.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.509
As you can see in this example,

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:07.599
our CAC was less than a $150 in range between 148-210.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:11.644
A good rule of thumb is that the CAC should be a fourth of your revenue.

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:14.319
If you're spending more than that,

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.239
then you are spending too much.

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:18.799
So, you're spending too much to get a customer,

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.500
to acquire a customer.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.885
Now, If you're spending less than that,

00:01:22.885 --> 00:01:25.750
you're actually losing business opportunities.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.599
So, this was one example to calculate the customer acquisition cost.
