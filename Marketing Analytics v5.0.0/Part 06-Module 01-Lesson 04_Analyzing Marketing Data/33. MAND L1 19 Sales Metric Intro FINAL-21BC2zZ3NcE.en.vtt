00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.625
Sales metrics borrow some terminology from marketing metrics.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:13.620
Sales cannot only focus on the end customer such as the consumer,

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.009
but also a company who will likely generate customers.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.590
In the case of WeCart from marketing,

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.129
we have thus far focused on the end consumer and

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:27.524
their order as our marketing focus or unit of analysis.

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:33.780
This type of model is called a business to consumer model or B2C.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.899
Let's say that we add an additional focus on

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.574
generating sales by reaching out to grocery stores.

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:45.065
This is where WeCart partners with the local grocery stores.

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:46.759
We can now gain access to

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:51.515
their customers and their local grocery stores can access a delivery service.

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:58.054
This type of business model is called a business to business model or B2B.

00:00:58.054 --> 00:01:00.710
So part of our sales team can focus on

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.445
the B2B model where each sales rep is trying to create a sales lead.

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:11.164
A sales lead would be a grocery store interested in partnering with WeCart.

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:14.090
If a grocery stores signs a deal,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.480
then it becomes a booking or a closed deal.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.270
We will talk about a sales funnel next.
