00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.889
Being successful at our paid marketing is all about putting the right message,

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:06.449
in front of the right consumer,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.734
at the right time, and for the right price.

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:12.149
When we talk about paid marketing channels,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.910
we're typically talking about any channel where we exchange

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.300
money to promote our message to an audience,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.835
and many of our organic channels can actually be upgraded to paid channels.

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:26.150
For example, I could post a video on YouTube for free,

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.234
but then I can pay to promote it,

00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:31.869
and this holds true for many platforms such as Twitter and Facebook,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.200
where you can also pay to promote your content or pay them to simply deliver

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.480
ads that are completely separate from

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.459
the content that you're publishing on your regular feed.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.844
Additionally, we can also buy ads that live is text on search engines,

00:00:45.844 --> 00:00:47.990
or display on blogs,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.250
or even ads on streaming platforms like Spotify.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.579
Additionally, we could exchange money to sponsor an event or

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.409
buy ads in traditional print publications such as magazines and newspapers.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.109
Now, each time we launch a paid campaign,

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.769
we have to assess the important metrics.

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:09.859
For our time together, we're going to stick with the digital channels because these

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:14.060
are where you'll spend most of your time and they're also the easiest to track,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.579
but you can always correlate these learnings to

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.774
the other areas of paid marketing that you may become involved in.

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:23.150
Let's look at all the pieces in motion and paid advertising so

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.705
we can evaluate how we'll begin to measure on these areas.

00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:28.969
So to keep things super simple,

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.054
when we do paid advertising,

00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:33.320
we're going to pay to gain access to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.324
an audience with the goal that this audience buys our product.

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:41.344
So we're going to measure our spend, the audience,

00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:42.664
where a message was served,

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.260
and any sales. Let's start with the message.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.859
We're going to create our advertisement and then we'll put it somewhere.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.364
It might live alongside a keyword on search.

00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:52.879
So as people enter queries,

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.444
our ads show up if we're bidding on those terms

00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:58.789
or through a placement on a particular website.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.605
It's here that the audience then has a chance to see our message.

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:04.890
We call this the ad impression.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.719
From here, they can choose to take an action such as a click.

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:12.050
Now, we may be paying just for the action when they click

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.055
or we might be paying every time our ad has an impression.

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:21.230
So the audience is now aware of our message and they have a chance to see this message,

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.364
and hopefully take an action such as a click,

00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:27.350
and from there, we're going to hope that they make a purchase.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.469
So within our paid channels,

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:33.935
we're primarily most concerned with the cost per impression,

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:35.569
the cost per click,

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.930
and the cost per customer acquisition.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.935
But there are other metrics that help us establish the health of our campaigns,

00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:46.025
and one such metric is your click-through rate.

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:52.405
The click-through is a step on the buyer's journey and it helps us to evaluate two areas.

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:54.925
Am I showing the right message,

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:58.355
and am I showing this message to the right audience?

00:02:58.354 --> 00:03:03.379
Additionally, we also look at where these campaigns showed up,

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.389
and as we layer in more data,

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.384
we can compare outcomes.

00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:11.299
So for example, we might see that we serve the same ad to multiple placements.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.930
Now, some of these placements might perform better than others.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.150
So while we have an aggregate number,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.075
say an overall CPA for that campaign,

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:24.094
we may have CPAs that vary by each placement.

00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:26.389
Think about the scale of many campaigns.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.494
Consider a prominent websites such as Amazon.com.

00:03:29.495 --> 00:03:31.310
They have all of these products.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.754
So when they buy ads, what is their goal?

00:03:33.754 --> 00:03:36.079
Well, they want to get traffic to those products.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.270
So when they go out to their paid channels,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.805
they have to figure out what makes the most sense.

00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:42.490
So if they're going to buy paid search ads,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.625
they're trying to figure out which keywords drive traffic to the right pages.

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:51.979
It won't make sense to serve the message of coffee mugs to people searching for jackets.

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.229
So Amazon has to work to optimize

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:58.879
their paid advertising to figure out which combinations deliver the best results.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.969
They may have to figure out exactly what pairs of

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.569
words such as coffee mugs or coffee cups should

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.734
go to which product because it's hard to understand

00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:12.530
which specific coffee mugs someone wants on a term that generic.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.419
So they may evaluate all of

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.199
the different landing pages that they're serving on that message.

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.490
The message may be the same,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.319
but the landing page may change.

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.230
So we have to start thinking about all of these layers that we

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.290
bake in when we understand what we're measuring.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.350
Another piece is our customer lifetime value.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.800
This makes the details that we're looking at incredibly important.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.480
It might make more sense to capture insight surrounding lifetime value so that we can

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.384
sort out which placements and which audience segments yield the best results.

00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:45.649
So we may find that we can improve

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:49.279
our lifetime value by delivering ads into one customer segment.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.634
If that was the case, we might actually be willing to

00:04:51.634 --> 00:04:54.844
increase our cost per clicks if at the same time,

00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:57.235
we improve our customer lifetime value.

00:04:57.235 --> 00:04:59.560
You see, all of this data works together,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.990
but we're going to leverage it depending on what our goals are,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.530
and then we use it to optimize and tell a story.

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.609
We can take a rather simplistic set of metrics and go deeper,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.860
ultimately, creating a complex model by which we're working to optimize.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.634
With paid, we're running these campaigns.

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:23.914
As we've seen, these campaigns are targeting messages to different customer segments.

00:05:23.915 --> 00:05:28.355
But these customers can be reached at varying times of the day on different devices.

00:05:28.355 --> 00:05:31.250
So they'll have different degrees of value to us.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.324
Now, we have even more data points that we want to capture.

00:05:34.324 --> 00:05:38.274
Let's say I was at restaurant and I'm serving lunch, who's more important to me?

00:05:38.274 --> 00:05:41.989
Customer within four blocks at 11:30 in the morning just before

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.220
lunchtime or customers 30 miles away at 11 o'clock at night.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.485
Of course the customer nearby is more important,

00:05:48.485 --> 00:05:50.050
so I'm going to pay more.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.329
Now, the customer far away might still be important if they're

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:56.779
searching for those lunch spots for tomorrow's business meeting.

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.189
But as you can see,

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:01.009
the insights that you gather with paid,

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.185
help you tell a higher-level story.

00:06:03.185 --> 00:06:05.810
It's a general narrative about your overall performance,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.939
but you're going to need to drill into all of

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.105
these deeper results to report on specific outcomes,

00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:15.035
specific metrics that you can leverage to change the outcome.

00:06:15.035 --> 00:06:16.939
As you continue to dig deeper,

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.670
you'll use the analytics to find areas for improvement.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.365
Because well, as you know,

00:06:21.365 --> 00:06:26.375
we're always wanting to be working towards information that lets us take action.

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:29.800
So let's take a quick second to recap where we are.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.035
The most important data in paid is going to be what we're spending.

00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:37.035
A cost-per-click, a cost per impression,

00:06:37.035 --> 00:06:38.985
or that cost per acquisition,

00:06:38.985 --> 00:06:41.230
then we have where we're showing up.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.370
Its placement by the sites that were landing on or keywords that we're targeting.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.829
Next, we're looking at how we're performing.

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:51.740
Our click-through rate, our conversion rates,

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.170
and then of course our customer lifetime value.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.439
We then work to analyze all of these metrics and take action by making

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:03.319
our hypothesis on what we want to test and

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:08.040
what adjustments we want to make to see if we can deliver better results.
