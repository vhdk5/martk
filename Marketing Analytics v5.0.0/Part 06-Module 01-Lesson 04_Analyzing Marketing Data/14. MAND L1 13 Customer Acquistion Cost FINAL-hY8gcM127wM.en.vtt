00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.820
Customer acquisition cost or CAC is used as a metric in

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.880
the very last step in our funnel where the customer

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.464
has actually bought a product or service on the website.

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:22.094
We use the CAC metric to figure out how much it costs as to acquire a paid customer.

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:27.585
Remember our ultimate goal is to increase these conversions at the bottom of the funnel.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:33.780
Considering e-commerce, shopping card abandonment rate are well over 60 percent,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.600
each company's goal is to make sure you are getting

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.984
higher levels of conversions for the minimum cost of sales and marketing,

00:00:40.984 --> 00:00:45.094
this idea is linked to the concept of optimizing the funnel.

00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:47.664
We will cover this later in the lesson.

00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:51.125
CAC is computed by dividing all the costs

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:54.829
spent on acquiring more customers, marketing expenses,

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.780
sales and marketing salaries,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.840
by the number of customers converted to paid customers in the period the money was spent.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.570
A good rule of thumb is that you want your CAC to be 25 percent of the revenue,

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.644
the money you earn from all your customers.

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:16.049
Next, you'll perform a sample computation of CAC.
