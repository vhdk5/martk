00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.080
Now we will shift gears to talk about metrics useful for measuring your company's growth.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.495
Here growth for a website or app,

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:15.089
is counted in the number of users.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.405
Are we seeing the number of people actually using the site increasing or decreasing?

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:23.145
If you seeing your website users high,

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:26.789
are they unique users or are the same people coming back?

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.719
An important aspect of growth is not just whether you have

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:35.989
users but whether they continue to actively use or engage with the website.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.300
We'll talked about the following metrics,

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:41.394
active users, which can range from monthly,

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:44.380
weekly to daily, stickiness,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.810
which is derived from the monthly and daily active users,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.940
and finally churn rate.

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:52.890
Ready? Let's jump into it.
