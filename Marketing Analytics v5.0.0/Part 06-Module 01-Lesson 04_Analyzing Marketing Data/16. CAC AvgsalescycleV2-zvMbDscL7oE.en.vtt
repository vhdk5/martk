00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.860
It is important to remember that sometimes some customers take

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.165
a long time to convert from leads to paying customers.

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:13.530
Maybe they sign up or register for a free account for some months,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.740
and then they are prompted to become a paying customer.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.370
In other words, your marketing campaign may take some time to

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.300
realize the revenues it is trying to generate.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.795
To come for that dealing in a lead conversion,

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:33.180
CAC is often calculated on the basis of your average sales cycle.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.400
Let's look at the following example.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.355
Here, we have a slightly different formula based on a 60-day average sales cycle.

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:45.915
We use the marketing cost for August,

00:00:45.915 --> 00:00:51.785
and then use a ratio of the sales and marketing salaries,

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:56.690
and overhead costs, for the previous two months.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.840
Don't get bogged down by the formula just yet.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.450
Let's make sure we cover the concept first.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.455
So think of it as you're still paying for those costs,

00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:12.520
the salaries, and the overhead cost,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.595
as you wait for the marketing cost, the 9,500,

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:26.810
to realize the lead conversion which is the average cycle of two months in this example.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.265
So here's a formula. We take the marketing costs for August,

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:38.310
and we take half of the overhead cost with sales and marketing from August.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.620
So we add this amount,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.820
the marketing cost for August and add it to half.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.690
So we multiply that with 0.5 of the overhead costs for August.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.680
So that's the sales and marketing salaries,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.950
plus the overhead cost.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.514
We add it to half of the overhead cost for September,

00:02:08.514 --> 00:02:12.920
because we're only taking into account the marketing cost for August and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.660
then averaging across the August and September overhead costs.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:46.100
I think it's done. So this is the numerator.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.335
The numerator is this,

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.450
plus half of this,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.045
and half of this.That's the numerator,

00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:58.400
and what you're then doing is you're actually dividing it by

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.450
the number of paid customers that you got in September.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.770
Because you're trying to gauge

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.070
what was the cost of acquiring these paid customers in September.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.425
If your sales cycle is two months,

00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:25.310
then you want to take the overhead costs for two months,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.055
so August and September, and average them,

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:30.925
and that's what the 0.5 is doing,

00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:34.400
and then you include the marketing cost.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.715
This amount you spent on marketing to these paid customers back in August,

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:48.040
and you divide it by the number of paid customers that you got in September.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.905
I've also included the formula here for you to see.

00:03:54.905 --> 00:04:00.840
So that's how you arrive at the CAC for the two month average cycle,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.000
and I copy the formula over to October as well.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.380
[inaudible].

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.440
So it's less confusing.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.869
So yes, you can see that the CAC is different

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:18.410
and lower than it was for the one-month cycle.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.205
It was 148 and 138 before,

00:04:22.205 --> 00:04:24.610
but now it's lower.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.015
There's a reason for this.

00:04:27.015 --> 00:04:30.035
Previously, you were overestimating it.

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:33.830
You were hoping that the leads will convert to customers in a month.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.650
When in fact, it takes them two months.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.940
Businesses can decide their marketing campaign spending based on CAC.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.140
So for that reason, it is important to get more accurate estimate of CAC.
