00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.129
To get the active user account monthly or daily,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.025
you need to first define what active means.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:15.495
For example, if you were on a social media platform like Facebook,

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:17.774
user is counted as active,

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:19.529
if the user logs in,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.220
likes, comments, or shares a post.

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.474
Defining what constitutes an active user

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.415
is an important part of calculating your growth metrics.

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:34.784
Monthly active users tells the number of users who were active in the last month.

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:39.689
Daily active users are the users who were active in the previous day.

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:45.004
Engagement or actual use of the website will differ depending on the website.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:46.850
For a weak hard business,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.560
engagement could take the form of users who are using it to check the prices,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.859
are those ordering groceries.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.539
Once you have your active user accounts,

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.200
it is easier to see how the visitors are using the website.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.765
You can even narrow this down to specific features or market segments.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:09.859
Let's look at this graph from the website linked below.

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:16.010
This timeline graph shows the year on your monthly active user growth for

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.210
Facebook across specific world regions between 2013 and 2015.

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:27.304
On the y-axis is the number of active users in millions.

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:31.640
You can see right away how the monthly active user growth in

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.694
Asia was much higher than for North America and Europe.

00:01:36.694 --> 00:01:42.364
That meant Facebook users in Asia we're using the site more frequently,

00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:45.409
and the number was increasing steadily.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.204
The life for North America and Europe shows the monthly active user trend flattening off.

00:01:52.204 --> 00:01:53.899
In the next video,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.530
we capture how to use monthly active users and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.030
daily active user metric together to create a new engagement metric.
