00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
When it comes to measuring our owned channels,

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:05.339
we're going to spend a lot of time looking at our website.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.080
This is because our website is typically core to our marketing efforts.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.554
We know that we can measure just about every way a user interacts with our website.

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:17.280
From where they came from,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.855
to what they're doing on our site,

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:20.594
to even how they're doing it.

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:25.324
Now, other aspects of your owned include email marketing,

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:29.179
the interactions users is taking within your product or application,

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.719
and even the content that you're distributing on your social channels.

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.179
Now, there's also an argument to be made that

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.344
SEO lives somewhat in the own space as well.

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:41.600
You'll earn the actual listing on say Google,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.140
but you own everything that you do to improve your site and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.710
your content to capture that listing and generate that rank.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.664
Now, we also have to consider the sales process.

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:53.539
All the steps that we control.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.969
From the user becoming aware of our brand,

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.574
to that conversion event.

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:02.930
We even look beyond the sales process at retention metrics such as Churn.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.704
Now, there's a lot of data within our own channels.

00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:09.015
Let's talk about some common questions that we'll answer.

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:12.439
Earlier, you spent quite a bit of time with Google Analytics.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.500
I don't feel it's necessary for us to explore all of

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.280
those common datasets and where you're gathering that information instead,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.965
I want to focus just on our blog.

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:25.549
Let's evaluate what data is important with our blog.

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.560
Now for starters, we're obviously interested in how much traffic is arriving to our blog.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.159
That is a good signal of how it's performing but beyond that,

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.049
we have our engagement metrics.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.289
These are datapoints like Time on the Page.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.475
We use Time on Page to understand if people are actually reading the content.

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:45.140
If you have a very long article,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.909
and you notice that your time on that page is only 20 seconds,

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.979
well you have a good assumption that something is wrong there.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.710
This also goes into your bounce rate.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.654
If a lot of people are leaving the site after they visit this page,

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:01.075
then you need to understand why aren't they staying?

00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:04.850
Why aren't they continuing on into other pages of your site?

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.914
We also want to understand where this traffic is coming from.

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:13.699
We need to evaluate if we're resonating with the right audiences.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.929
If we're trying to get traffic coming for a particular source and it's not happening,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.879
we need to figure out why.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.724
Now, there are some other questions that we want to answer.

00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:23.949
Is this content resonating?

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:30.769
Which of our content is most popular and what content is driving the most revenue for us?

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.005
Now, we can think even broader.

00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:36.625
We might look at how the blog is assisting with our conversions.

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:39.814
The blog lives somewhere in that customer journey.

00:02:39.814 --> 00:02:43.939
So we need to understand what the cost being spent on the Blogger and then

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.669
evaluate if it's doing its job to

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.424
demonstrate that it's bringing us a return on investment.

00:02:50.425 --> 00:02:52.680
Let's move on to e-mail marketing.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.730
We looked at e-mail and we often primarily study

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.774
the open rate and the click-through rate on our messages.

00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:01.640
These are engaged with metrics and they help us understand if

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.944
the audience is engaging with the content that we're sending them.

00:03:04.944 --> 00:03:07.680
Now, we can start by comparing those metrics.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.784
We could look at the trends over time.

00:03:09.784 --> 00:03:11.615
Are our open rates getting better?

00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:13.370
Are they getting worse? Our click-through rates

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.045
improving and this could be a function of how we're adjusting the content.

00:03:17.044 --> 00:03:19.714
But we also need to look at the larger narrative.

00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:23.719
How many emails did we send to a particular segment each week?

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.655
That could influence the open rates.

00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:28.955
More emails, perhaps we see less open rates.

00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:31.465
What about how many spam complaints we're getting?

00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:34.219
This could identify, that the message we sent was

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.234
particularly off-brand or maybe out of character.

00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:40.760
Perhaps we were pushing the wrong information and it didn't resonate.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.829
Now, zooming out even more,

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.930
we might measure performance against days of

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.635
the week or what types of headlines resonate the most.

00:03:48.634 --> 00:03:50.479
Let's move on to SEO.

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.079
With SEO, we're looking at our organic traffic.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.980
This is traffic coming from search engines like Google or Bing.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:02.554
Now, we also want to evaluate whether we have growth in this channel.

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:04.879
If we're publishing more content,

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.150
what we're going to expect that our organic traffic grows.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.605
If we're not seeing growth,

00:04:09.604 --> 00:04:11.134
well then we have issues.

00:04:11.134 --> 00:04:14.149
We might also want to start comparing how traffic from

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.524
SEO performance is relative to traffic from other sources.

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:20.239
Let's say a blog article is being trafficked from

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.694
an e-mail campaign but we're also getting traffic from our search results.

00:04:24.694 --> 00:04:26.240
We can look at the bounce rate.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.644
What if search had a really high bounce rate but e-mail did not have a high bounce rate?

00:04:31.644 --> 00:04:34.549
Well then we could figure out perhaps that this content is

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.370
not resonating with the group coming in for search.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.840
Perhaps the group coming from e-mail is more familiar with our brand and we need to do

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:43.729
something to help the group coming from

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.240
search understand who we are so they stay on the page longer.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.879
Now, let's talk about our social channels.

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.259
With our social channels,

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.219
we primarily look at engagement metrics but before we look at those,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.600
we might start by asking ourselves,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.480
how much content did we publish?

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.180
How did this channel perform as a referral source?

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.275
So we're trying to understand if the content we're publishing is driving traffic.

00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:11.074
Then we can understand,

00:05:11.074 --> 00:05:14.689
is the content that we're publishing bringing us brand engagements?

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.430
Are we getting likes, comments and retweets?

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.480
We can look at data there to see what our reach was.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.754
How many impressions we generated by impacting and influencing that audience to engage.

00:05:26.754 --> 00:05:31.670
Now, the list for everything here can be exhaustive because with owned,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.175
you're going to spend a lot of time comparing

00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:37.340
all of these metrics in order to tell a full story.

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:40.954
The important thing is to learn where all of this data lives.

00:05:40.954 --> 00:05:42.680
So you know where to go to grab it,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.670
how to compare it and how to use it to answer those key questions.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.160
In just a moment, we'll spend some time exploring

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.850
these platforms and the key questions that you'll be answering together.
