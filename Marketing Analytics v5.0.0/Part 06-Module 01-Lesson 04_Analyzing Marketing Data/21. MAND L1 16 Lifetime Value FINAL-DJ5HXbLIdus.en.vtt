00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:07.469
When you decide how to spend your marketing budget,

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.289
you want to focus on some of your best customers.

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.454
Customers who will stay with you for the long-term,

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:17.759
who will continue to generate revenue for the company longer than

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.679
say a customer who finds a cheaper deal somewhere else and leaves your website.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.960
In other words, you want to identify

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.300
your high value customer so that you can focus on bringing in more of these customers.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.870
Think of it this way,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.780
your goal is for every dollar you spend on your marketing efforts to give

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.285
you a higher rate of return and generate revenue multiple times over.

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:44.219
How do you go about doing that?

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.950
You use a business metric called lifetime value of a customer.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.260
To calculate lifetime value,

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.664
let's cover a few key concepts.

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:58.714
Again, make sure you make a note of the terminology and definitions.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:00.950
The greater gets slightly complicated,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.710
but we will walk through each of them one by one.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.359
So keep in mind we want to be able to estimate how much revenue we can expect

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:13.129
to earn per customer as far into the future as we can.

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:16.579
To calculate this, we need to take into account a lot of

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.629
different metrics and data to create a single LTV metric.

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:25.489
First, purchase cycle is a time period that

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:30.174
depicts the general frequency with which your products are purchased.

00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:35.299
At Udacity, if we start a new Nanodegree class every two weeks,

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.670
two weeks would be the purchase cycle.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.275
Total sale revenue per cycle is a revenue earned from all customers per purchase cycle.

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:49.100
Number of sales per purchase cycle is the number of

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:53.269
times your average customer buys during the purchase cycle.

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:55.685
Cost per acquisition.

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:57.140
You've seen this before.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.530
It's a total cost of marketing and sales divided by the number of new leads.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.234
With me this far, feel free to pause the video

00:02:06.234 --> 00:02:10.284
or revise review and think about what I've said this far.

00:02:10.284 --> 00:02:13.990
Next, we have expectation retention time.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.530
This is the amount of time you expect to retain the customer.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.439
This is measured in terms of purchase cycles.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.960
What we covered right at the top of this list.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.754
So if we expect a customer to be retained for a year given a two-week purchase cycle,

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:33.430
then we have an ERT off about 26.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.760
Average sales revenue is the revenue you earn from

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.899
the average customer per transaction during the cycle.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.810
This is the total customer revenue divided by the number of purchases in the cycle.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.909
Profit margin per customer is the percentage of sales that has turned into profits.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.655
Again, feel free to pause the video here and process what I've covered this far.

00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:04.930
Next, we have one last thing to do,

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.280
calculate the lifetime value.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.430
Lifetime value is the average sale,

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.740
times the number of repeated sales,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.335
times the expected retention time, times profit margin.

00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:21.920
Essentially, this is the net profit you can attribute to

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.794
the customer over the length of their relationship with the company.

00:03:26.794 --> 00:03:30.359
Let's do this in Excel in the next video.
