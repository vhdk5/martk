00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.128
The sales funnel also called a sales pipeline

00:00:08.128 --> 00:00:11.640
tracks the number of incoming leads or prospects.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.070
These are leads that a sales team member has

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.760
identified as being potentially interested in the product.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.545
Then the sales team member follows up for an interested lead to

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:27.810
ask more about what they're looking for possibly making presentations.

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.500
Here you track metrics like number of sales leads,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.670
this is followed by a qualifying process whereas the sales team

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.325
qualifies the leads checks to see if the product offering is within the leads budget,

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:47.075
a vetting to identify the ideal buyer and confirm their viable lead.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:51.910
Here you track metrics like ratio of qualified leads to sales leads.

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:57.649
Once the sales team has a qualified lead you end with a closed deal or booking.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.149
At this stage you can also have a lead on hold or last.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.968
Here you track metrics like bookings,

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:09.109
close ratio and average size of deal in pipeline.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:14.375
Bookings is a very important metric for tracking the success of the sales team.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:21.394
Close ratio is the ratio of close deals to leads you had in the sales pipeline.

00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:24.799
As you may have noticed sales metrics are measuring

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.504
the performance of the sales team internal to the company,

00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:34.234
as oppose to tracking the behavior of individual customers in the marketing metrics.

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:38.045
For this lesson we will cover the metrics at the bottom of the funnel.

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:40.790
But we have provided links and resources

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.240
below for you to learn more about the others if you're interested.
