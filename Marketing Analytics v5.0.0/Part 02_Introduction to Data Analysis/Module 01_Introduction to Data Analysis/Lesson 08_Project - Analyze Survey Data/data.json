              "text": "## Project Overview\n\nIn this project, you will analyze a  **real** dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so it isn't perfect.  It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing).  You will need to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate your findings about it. You will use spreadsheets to make your analysis easier (please do not analyze by hand - it will take forever!).\n\nPrepare with the descriptive statistics and spreadsheets lessons leading up to the project.\n\n## What do I need to install?\n\nYou may use any spreadsheet application you like. This includes Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, etc.\nPlease note .CSV files may not save more than the active tab you are on at the time you close the file and it is recommended to use a spreadsheet tool like the two mentioned above for your work.\n\n## Why this Project?\n\nThis project will introduce you to the data analysis process that you will be using throughout the rest of the Nanodegree program. In this project, you will go through the process of calculating summary statistics and building visual methods of spreadsheet data to find interesting information out about Udacity students - **students just like you**. The goal is that you not only can perform an analysis, but also that you can communicate the results in a way that is clear and compelling.\n\n## What skills will I use?\n\nAfter completing the lessons and the project, you should feel comfortable in your ability to:\n\n* Identify different datatypes to determine what analyses are possible.\n* Calculate measures of center and spread to describe quantitative data.\n* Use a variety of spreadsheet functionality to gain insights from data.\n* Build charts and graphs to communicate the results of your analysis\n* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions\n* Analyze a future dataset using Excel\n\n## Project Details\n\nThe data used for this project was collected from Udacity students who responded to a survey. This project is made of **two** parts.  For both parts you will be using the same dataset, which you can find in the **Supporting Materials** as **Surveydata3.csv** at the bottom of this page.  You will notice that some information has been removed to assure the privacy of the student respondents.\n\n1. The first part of the project is a set of quiz questions, which you will find in the upcoming concepts.  These concepts are aimed to help you get familiar with the dataset and test that you have mastered the core concepts in the previous lessons.  Correctly answering each of the quiz questions will assure you are on the right track before you dive into the second part of the project.  **This part of the project will not be submitted for review.**<br><br>\n\n2. The second part of your project is the portion you will turn in for review.  You will need to **create a presentation** to be reviewed.  The details of this submission are detailed in the last page in this lesson.  Pay attention to the details of the [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/975/view) to assure you have all deliverables.  **In order to review your presentation, you will need to save your slides as a `PDF`.**  \n\n## Project Walkthrough\n\nThis video shows one of our instructors giving some great hints and tips for how to get started with your project: [Walkthrough Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkpTBa4jVSQ&feature=youtu.be)",

All questions where the answer lives across multiple columns, combine into a single column and remove the original columns.  Keep only the combined column.<br><br>\n2. Change all the column names to have no spaces, but still be informative.  This isn't necessary, but just a recommendation.  Depending on what you do with the data in the future having spaces or special characters in the column names may not work nicely.  You will see this in the next content on SQL.<br><br>\n3.  Change the birthdate column to an age column by finding the number of days from that date to today, and then dividing by 365.",

A visual is so much more useful for explaining what is going on when we have variables that can take on lots of different values.  The main way we might look at the **categorical** variables is using **bar charts**, and the main method for looking at **quantitative** variables is using **histograms**.  \n\nYou will need to use software to create your own visuals, but in this section, we walk through some of the visuals I created from this dataset.  Below are histograms for many of our variables.  Some of them are not very informative because I have not done anything with outliers (something you will want to do in the second part of this project).  \n\nIn order to better view any of the below images, please click the image.

The plot on the left is an example of a plot you **should not build to be submitted**.\n\nAdditionally choose summary statistics that best convey your message.

              "text": "## How do You Complete this Project?\n\nThis project is connected with the Introduction to Data Part section of the course, but depending on your background knowledge, you may not need to take this module to complete this project.\n\n### Introduction \n\nFor the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a presentation to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it - the questions leading to this page should have assisted in this process!  Then you should use spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.  This project is open-ended in that there is not one right answer.\n\n### Step One - Understanding the Data - How the Data Were Collected\n\nIt is common practice in marketing to send surveys to learn about your audience, and build a product that best meets their needs.  The survey that this project is based of off was sent to just do that for Udacity to learn about the students across many of their programs!  Download the dataset of responses from the **Resources** to your local machine.  The dataset can also be found in the resources. \n\nPlease note .CSV files may not save more than the active tab you are on at the time you close the file and it is recommended to use a spreadsheet workbook program like Excel. Please be sure you also use a workbook file type. \n### Step Two - Get Organized\n\nWhen you complete your analysis and presentation you’ll want to submit your project (and share it with friends, family, and employers). Get organized before you begin. I recommend creating a single folder that will eventually contain:\n\n* The **report** communicating your findings\n* The original **data set** (which you will not need to submit)\n* A copy of the spreadsheet workbook you used to do the analysis for your report (which you will need to submit)\n\nPlease note, .CSV files will only save the active tab in Microsoft Excel. If needed, please export or change the file type to a workbook file that supports saving more than one tab, such as .xlsx. Some spreadsheet workbooks, like Sheets or Numbers, may do this when you import the .CSV file. \n   \n### Step Three - Analyze Your Data\n\nLook through the survey questions and brainstorm some questions you could answer, then use the `.csv` file to answer your questions. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n* What is the most common way people find out about Udacity?\n* What is the highest level of education for most students?\n* What is the most common Nanodegree program represented in the survey results?\n* Is there a connection between the Nanodegree certificate earned and job title?\n* What are the most common countries/cities where students live?\n* How many hours per week do students spend on projects/content?  Does this differ by program?\n* Are there any interesting findings regarding sleep, commute times, amount of time sitting per day, etc. worth mentioning?  Does this differ by where someone lives? Does this differ by Nanodegree program or job title?\n    \nTry and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between variables, as well as questions about individual columns.\n\n### Step Four - Create Your Presentation\n\nOnce you have finished analyzing the data, create a presentation that shares the findings you found most interesting. You should clearly communicate what broad conclusions you are able to make, and provide a visual or numeric values associated with your finding. \n\n**Your presentation should include:**\n* Four slides\n* One visualization and at least one numeric summary statistic about a finding per slide.  An appropriate visual might be a **bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, box-plot** or other visual that you learned to make in spreadsheets.\n* A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide\n\nThe submission template is a Google Slides file. Make a copy of the submission template to complete your project. We suggest you use the layout provided, though it is not a requirement.\n\n**Put your presentation and spreadsheet workbook you used to do the analysis in a folder and zip it. Then submit the zipped folder for your project**\n \n<center><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LXXNnKJxJUmH410PvbAfk0KH2pZzwOiG8esEFTQ_IBQ/edit#slide=id.g1d6d4cc2e8_0_9\" target=\"_blank\"><button style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 4px; background: #02B3E4; border: none; height: 44px; padding: 0 25px; color: white; cursor: pointer; font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif; display: inline-block; border: none; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: 1px; font-weight: 600; text-transform: uppercase;\">Submission Template</button></a></center>\n\n\n### Step Five - Check the Rubric\n\nUse the [**Project Rubric**](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/49cb17b7-f54a-436a-a9fa-0b65d46a06c2/rubric) to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you're ready to submit your project. If you see room for improvement, keep working to improve your project.\n\n**In order to review your presentation, you will need to save your slides as a `PDF`.**  You can do this from within Google Slides by selecting **File > Download as > PDF Document**.",

However, you should know that the plots you can make are tied to different data types. We go over those once again here.\n\n#### Plots You Can Use For Categorical Variables\n\nIf you have categorical data, here is a list of the possible univariate (one variable) plots you can make:\n\n1. Bar Chart\n2. Pie Chart\n\n#### Plots You Can Use For Quantitative Variables\n\nIf you have quantitative data, here is a list of the possible univariate plots you can make:\n\n1. Histogram\n2. Box Plot\n\n#### Plots to Compare 2 Variables\n\nIf you are interested in comparing two **quantitative** variables, then the main way to perform this comparison is with a scatterplot.  However, if one of the variables is related to time, then a line plot is frequently used.  \n\n# Statistics\n\n#### Quantitative Variables\n\nWhen describing quantitative variables, it is common to use the statistics discussed earlier:\n\n1. Measures of center - mean, median, mode\n2. Measures of spread - standard deviation, range, IQR\n\n#### Categorical Variables\n\nHowever, when you are analyzing categorical variables, measures of center and spread **Do Not ** make sense.\n\nIn cases of describing categorical variables, you need to use percentages or counts.  Not means, medians, modes, standard deviations, or ranges.  \n\n#### Important Last Thought\n\nWith this in mind, think of the variable type of the columns you are analyzing, and determine which plots and statistics make sense for your analysis.\n",
