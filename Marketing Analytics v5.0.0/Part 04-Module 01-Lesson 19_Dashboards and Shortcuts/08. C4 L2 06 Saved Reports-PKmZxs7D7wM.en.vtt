00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
Let's talk about Saved Reports.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.799
Right now I'm in one of

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.939
the two treemaps reports that are available within Google Analytics.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:14.744
There's a treemaps report for all traffic and a treemaps report specifically for AdWords.

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:16.980
We haven't visited these reports yet,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.420
but they can be a very useful format for comparing two metrics.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.660
One metric is displayed by size of the square

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.285
and the other metric is displayed by color gradation.

00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:31.804
Let's change the primary metric to sessions

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:35.659
and the secondary metric to e-commerce conversion rate.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:41.179
Now, we can see at a glance which channels are sending significant numbers of sessions,

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.259
and how those channels are performing in terms of e-commerce conversion rate.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:47.899
A good way to identify high performance or

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.574
low performance in channels that are sending a lot of traffic.

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:56.840
We see that the referral channel is sending a significant number of sessions,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.940
and it is performing well in terms of e-commerce conversion rate.

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:03.289
We can drill down into referral and get

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.358
even more insight as to which sources account for the greatest number of referrals,

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:12.354
and how those sources are performing in terms of e-commerce conversion rate.

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:15.500
Let's say that you wanted to make sure to refer to this report

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.920
configured as is at any later time,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.439
you wouldn't have to find the report again and manually

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.579
reconstruct the configuration that you currently have.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.375
What you could do is click Save, enter a name.

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:35.105
Let's call this treemaps channels sessions versus e-commerce conversion rate.

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:36.530
Click Okay.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.394
Now, we could navigate away from this report.

00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:42.170
Now, we can click Customization,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.615
Saved Reports, and here's the exact report configuration that we have saved.

00:01:47.614 --> 00:01:50.689
Notice that all of the same settings are still in place.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.834
So, if you get a report looking exactly the way you want in terms of display,

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:59.284
drill down, filtering, or segments,

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:03.859
you can save the report and refer to it again anytime down the road.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.224
Notice that there is not an option for sharing saved reports

00:02:08.224 --> 00:02:13.159
because saved reports can have a dependency on a segment that's applied,

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.384
and not all users have access to the same segments.

00:02:16.384 --> 00:02:22.439
Therefore, saved reports are truly a personal asset within Google Analytics.
