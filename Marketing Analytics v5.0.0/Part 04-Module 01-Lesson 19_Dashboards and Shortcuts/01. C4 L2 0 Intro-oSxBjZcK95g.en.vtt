When you work as a marketer or analyst in a larger organization,

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:08.429
you will want to share your dashboards and reports with your colleagues.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.344
Google Analytics makes that very easy, but what's more,

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.339
once you've created the dashboard that you

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.009
believe could be helpful for a wider community,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.090
you can make your template available to more people, and of course,

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.814
you can benefit from templates that other analysts have already created.

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:29.609
Let's take a look at how this all works in this lesson.
