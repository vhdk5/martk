00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.715
In the previous section,

00:00:01.715 --> 00:00:07.495
we saw the option to import from gallery when we were creating a new dashboard.

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:09.669
If we click import from gallery,

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.830
we see the Google Analytics Solutions Gallery appear in a modal window.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.140
Let's give ourselves a little more room to work with.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.830
Let's just close out of this modal window for now,

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:26.799
open up a new tab and search for Google Analytics Solutions Gallery.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.330
Let's click Browse.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.929
There are many selections that we could make in the left panel.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.829
We can filter by type of asset we want to import the configuration for.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.214
Some of these assets will probably be a little more useful than others.

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:44.210
To me, something like a goal or

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.100
a channel grouping is probably a little too individualized for me to want to import.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.135
Potentially attribution model, definitely channel grouping, dashboard, and segments.

00:00:56.134 --> 00:01:00.589
Those are really the classic shareable Google Analytics configurations.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.284
On the top we see Occam's Razor Awesomeness from our friend Avinash.

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:06.979
If we click import,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.960
let's note a couple of things here.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:12.439
One is that we're being asked to view that we want to import

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.920
these configurations into and we're not importing any data.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.600
Just the configurations.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:20.269
That will work with the data in the view.

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:24.829
Also notice we can import many configurations at one time.

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.709
There are a number of segments and custom reports

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.430
and one dashboard included in this one import.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.845
You can deselect any assets that you don't want to include in the import.

00:01:35.844 --> 00:01:37.605
Let's cancel out of this for now,

00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:40.505
and let's look at some other options for filtering.

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:44.599
We can also filter by category, custom reports,

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:50.584
dashboards, and segments certainly can have a specific category focus.

00:01:50.584 --> 00:01:53.000
Let's select site optimization.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.599
Let's import the site performance dashboard

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.079
from another one of our Google Analytics friends, Justin Cutroni.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.239
We can import directly from here.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:06.839
Select a view, what's important to the Master View of the merchandise store.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.830
We don't have to worry about importing into a test view first

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.535
because none of these assets will alter the underlying report data.

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:16.900
So now, we have a site performance dashboard.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.750
If you did decide that this dashboard wasn't right for you,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.080
you can either edit it or you could delete it.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.610
No harm done at all.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.150
Make sure to experiment with importing custom reports

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.090
and dashboards and segments from the Solutions Gallery.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.420
It's always good to get ideas and

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.739
inspirations from others in the Google Analytics community.
