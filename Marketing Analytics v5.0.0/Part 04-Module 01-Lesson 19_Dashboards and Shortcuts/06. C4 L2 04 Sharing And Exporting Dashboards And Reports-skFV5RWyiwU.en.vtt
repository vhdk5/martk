00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
When we first clicked into the dashboards panel

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:07.054
in the main view of the merchandise store property,

00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:09.449
we saw several shared views.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:15.619
Shared views are created by one user and shared with other users who access the view.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.509
Let's see how we would share a dashboard that we've created.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.100
You do need to have a collaborate access to the view to share a dashboard.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.560
If you click Share at the top of a dashboard and you see share object,

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:31.574
this means that you do have collaborate access and you can

00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:35.879
share the dashboard to be viewed by anyone who does access the view.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.719
Share object is a little bit of an unexpected name,

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.140
but this does just mean share the dashboard for anyone who accesses the view.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.270
Let's talk about sharing outside of the view by exporting or by emailing.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.225
We can export or email built-in reports,

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:55.975
or customer reports, or dashboards.

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:59.960
The export and email features are fairly straightforward.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.295
Let's check them out in our Ecommerce by Country custom report.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:07.775
For export, we have the option of PDF Google Sheets,

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:10.000
Excel, and CSV format.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.444
If we click Share,

00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:13.174
this is the email feature.

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:16.399
We can share as PDF, Excel, or CSV.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.300
Notice that we can set up the email to be recurring.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.045
We could send it one time only or we could pick

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:26.375
an interval anywhere from daily to quarterly.

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:30.170
I believe that this is actually the only instance in

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.564
the GUI where we do see quarterly as an option for a time interval.

00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:42.539
Let's say I'm going to send this to manager@xyz.com monthly.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.680
Note that when you click Send for a scheduled email,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.000
you're not sending right now.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.030
You're scheduling the email to go out.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.250
If you do ever want to cancel that email,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.915
you can go into the Admin,

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:56.945
Scheduled Emails, and Delete.

00:01:56.944 --> 00:02:00.004
The scheduling of dashboards, custom reports,

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.699
and built-in reports is a useful and important feature

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.629
because it allows you to more easily keep different stakeholders involved.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.625
You're not going to think of all the questions that you need to on your own.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:16.909
You want to keep other stakeholders involved with

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.310
different perspectives and different questions

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.310
for different types of analysis and insight.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.569
The reason that it's recommended to use dashboards and custom reports for

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.324
your scheduled emails is that you can make them very customized to each stakeholder.

00:02:31.324 --> 00:02:35.419
We definitely don't want to send the same information to everyone.

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.750
These are some examples of the types of data that we

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.319
would want to surface for different roles within our organization.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.530
A designer or a developer would not be as

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.265
interested in the same things as a social media manager.

00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:54.454
Notice that the format I'm suggesting here is not a built-in report.

00:02:54.455 --> 00:02:59.120
We're going to be able to do a better job of sending relevant reports to

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.284
different stakeholders if we use a dashboard or a custom report.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:09.409
Let's consider other ways to export Google Analytics data or at least to view

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.034
Google Analytics data outside of GA. We want to remember visualization tools,

00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:18.770
especially Data Studio, which makes it so easy for us

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.135
to pull in Google Analytics data and visualize it in different ways.

00:03:23.134 --> 00:03:27.054
So, we're not so much exporting to Data Studio,

00:03:27.055 --> 00:03:29.990
but we definitely can surface Google Analytics data

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.715
richly in Data Studio as another environment.

00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:38.689
Another export option that will check out is the Google Analytics Spreadsheet Add-on

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.655
that will provide additional flexibility for getting GA data into Google Sheets.

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:45.860
We're in an empty Google Sheet.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.655
I'm going to click Add-ons, Get add-ons.

00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:52.520
This is the Google Analytics Spreadsheet Add-on.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.485
Add. Allow. Now in our Add-ons menu,

00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:01.760
we have the Google Analytics Spreadsheet option: Create new report.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:05.974
You do need edit access to the view that you do want to read from.

00:04:05.974 --> 00:04:08.495
For dimensions, let's say,

00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:13.205
Source/Medium, Metrics, Sessions, Bounce Rate.

00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:15.469
I'll just do something very basic.

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.269
We can add segments as well.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.875
We want to stay aware of sampling if we do at segments.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.290
We'll just call the report Source/Medium.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.620
Click Create Report to create the configuration.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.730
Click again on Add-ons, Google Analytics,

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.370
and we could either schedule the report to run at a regular interval,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.035
we'll cancel out of this for now,

00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:39.525
or run the report right now.

00:04:39.524 --> 00:04:44.139
Note that you can't have more than one report configuration per sheet,

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.599
which can be a good way to pull in data from multiple GA views at one time.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.685
To learn more about the Google Analytics Spreadsheet plugin,

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:55.100
search for Google Analytics Spreadsheet Add-on,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.875
and there's some good additional information here.

00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:01.795
Also, as you're putting together your exports,

00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:05.884
you can refer to the Google Analytics Dimensions and Metrics Explorer.

00:05:05.884 --> 00:05:09.050
This is a listing of all of the dimensions and metrics that are

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.360
available through the API and through the Google Analytics UI.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.449
So, for instance, instead of searching through the UI for

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.170
the goal dimensions and metrics that you could export,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.560
you can list them out in the Dimensions and Metrics Explorer.
