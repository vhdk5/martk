00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
In the previous sections,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.445
we've spoken mostly about sharing in the context

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:09.675
of actually sharing populated reports or data.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.825
In this section, we're going to talk about sharing

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:16.079
configurations of your Google Analytics assets.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.914
In the view column of the admin screen.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:21.419
We can click Share Assets,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.245
and here we see all of the sharable assets within the view.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:29.144
To see the types of assets that we can share, let's sort by type.

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:32.354
We see custom reports, dashboards,

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:38.204
channel groupings, let's drop down to a 100 goals and segments.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.479
Note that we could share more than one asset at a time.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:46.699
For instance, if I wanted to share a custom report and a dashboard,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.830
I could select both of those assets,

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.405
click share, keep share template link selected,

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:55.280
click share again and this is the link that you can

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.759
forward to share one or more configurations.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:03.964
If I'm sharing this link say with someone in another division of my company,

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:08.000
I can copy that URL and when my colleague receive the URL,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.819
they could enter it into the browser and they'll

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:14.209
receive a prompt for which view to copy the assets into.

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.879
This may look familiar to you from when we pulled

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:19.789
in a dashboard from the solutions gallery.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.255
It's the same mechanism.

00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:23.929
Day-to-day you're probably not going to

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.945
share Google Analytics configurations that frequently.

00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:30.364
But there are some scenarios that are particularly useful,

00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:33.454
especially involving sharing with yourself.

00:01:33.454 --> 00:01:37.310
If you want to use the same custom report across accounts,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.379
you could share that custom report with

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:43.384
yourself and copy the configuration into another account.

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:47.000
The same thing for sharing dashboards across views.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.790
When we've configured a goal and a text view,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.715
we don't want to reinvent the wheel and the main view.

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:55.850
The best way to copy the goal from the test view to

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.419
the main view is to share the configuration with yourself.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.090
Of course, you can share any asset in the solutions gallery.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.710
If you've created a custom report or

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.250
a dashboard that you think might be useful to others in the community,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.909
you can go to the Solutions Gallery and click Create.

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.914
You're not actually creating the asset here you're sharing the asset.

00:02:17.914 --> 00:02:21.349
If you have created a particularly useful configuration,

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.109
you can feel free to share it in the Solutions Gallery.
