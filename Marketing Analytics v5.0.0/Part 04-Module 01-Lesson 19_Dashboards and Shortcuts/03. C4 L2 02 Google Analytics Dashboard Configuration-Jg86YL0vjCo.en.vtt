00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
There are three ways that we can create a dashboard within

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.644
GA. We can start with a Blank Canvas.

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:09.224
We can use a Starter Dashboard,

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:12.314
or we can import from the Solutions Gallery.

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:15.404
We can look at the Solutions Gallery a little bit later.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:18.689
But for now, let's use a Starter Dashboard.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.450
We're in the Google merchandise store account.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.259
Under customization dashboards, we see that

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.900
there are several shared dashboards already created within the view.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.739
We'll also talk about shared dashboards coming up.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.019
For now, we'll click Create.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
Blank Canvas is selected by default and it can't be a great exercise to

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:44.045
build a dashboard from a Blank Canvas choosing all of the widgets yourself.

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:46.745
But for now, we'll select Starter Dashboard,

00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:49.049
will name it Eric Demo Dashboard.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.979
Click Create Dashboard.

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.894
The dashboard functionality in GA is very flexible

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:58.840
and very straightforward in terms of the types of data that you can add.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.225
So we won't go through an exhaustive list of

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:05.079
every type of data and widget that we could add to a dashboard.

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.105
But let's look at one example.

00:01:07.105 --> 00:01:12.980
Add widget, we can add Standard widgets and we can also add Real-time widgets.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.805
Let's select a Counter widget showing active users as the metric.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:23.575
Active users in the real-time reports mean any user that's interacted,

00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:26.659
sending a hit within the last five minutes.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.769
Let's group by country as a dimension.

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:34.459
We could also add a filter if we want it to within the widget.

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.734
We could link to a GA report within the view from the dashboard.

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:41.959
I'll select Audience/Geo/Location, save.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:47.074
There we have our active users real-time widget broken down by country.

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:51.960
As far as configuring the look and feel of the dashboard goes in GA,

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.079
we don't have lots of options.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.984
Scott will walk us through

00:01:55.984 --> 00:02:01.019
the formatting flexibility in Data Studio in an upcoming lesson.

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:02.795
Within the GA dashboards,

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:08.120
we do have the option to customize the layout.That's like 30 percent,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.810
70 percent, and now we change the layout of the dashboard.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.189
So not lots of options for customizing the look and feel of the dashboard,

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:21.349
but lots of options for displaying the Google Analytics data that way we want.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.229
As another comparison with Data Studio,

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.079
Google Analytics dashboards just pull in

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.900
Google Analytics data or any other data that we've incorporated into GA such

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.705
as AdWords data or

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:41.660
Google Search console data or we're using Google Analytics 360 double-click data.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.520
But the Google Analytics dashboards are basically about the Google Analytics dataset.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.070
When Scott walks us through Data Studio,

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.364
we'll also see the ability to add

00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:55.325
many different types of datasets to Data Studio dashboards.

00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:57.875
Just as a few quick notes on limits,

00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:01.205
there can be 50 shared dashboards per view.

00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:04.969
Again, we'll talk about sharing dashboards coming up.

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.479
We can each create 20 private dashboards per view.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:12.989
We can add a total of 12 widgets per dashboard.
