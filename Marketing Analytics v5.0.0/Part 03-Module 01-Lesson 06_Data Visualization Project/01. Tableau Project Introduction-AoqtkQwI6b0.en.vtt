00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
In this project, you'll have the opportunity to combine

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.490
a lot of what you've learned throughout this entire program.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.405
This final project is challenging and there isn't a lot of guidance provided,

00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:13.102
as we want you to have the freedom to be creative.

00:00:13.102 --> 00:00:16.449
The dataset that you're working with is real and it's pretty big.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.550
When you are an analyst for a company,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.530
there often isn't guidance as to how to correctly answer a particular question.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.365
And there might not really be one right answer.

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:29.530
Leverage your own skills and ask questions when you get stuck.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.274
Make sure you look through the directions carefully.

00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:36.000
This is the last milestone before graduation. You can do it.
