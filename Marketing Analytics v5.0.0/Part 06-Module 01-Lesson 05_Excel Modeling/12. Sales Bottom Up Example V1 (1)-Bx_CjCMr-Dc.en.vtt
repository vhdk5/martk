00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.645
So, let's walk through the sales model using a bottom-up approach.

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.359
I've kept the overarching themes here on the top,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.720
so you can see what is the motivation for each of these columns.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.234
We start with this column with a row for each sales team member.

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:16.035
This is followed by the company,

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:20.759
which is the company name for which you are going to be selling products in bulk,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.725
and then comes in column C,

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:24.030
the units per month.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.940
So, this is the number of units this opportunity is likely to create a bookings for.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.185
Contract terms shows the number of months each opportunity is for.

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:37.460
Price for all units in one month shows the number of

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.939
units times the sales price per unit,

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:42.804
which is $5 here,

00:00:42.804 --> 00:00:47.524
and this is showing the sales price for their projected unit over a month.

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:50.225
For example, how much would Joe Smith,

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:51.920
working with company A,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.760
bring in revenues from the sale of 4,000 units per month?

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:59.750
Then you multiply that with the number of months in

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.524
the contract term to arrive at the bookings forecast.

00:01:03.524 --> 00:01:07.099
We can go one step further and multiply the bookings forecast with

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:11.464
the win probability to show a more realistic weighted forecast.

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:13.219
So, let's look at this example.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.605
We're more likely to get the sales contract with Corey Jones, Company C,

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:21.500
because it has a wind probability of 0.9,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.680
versus this opportunity with Joe Smith,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.890
Company A, which has a lower probability.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.405
So, the 290k is a weighted bookings forecast,

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:38.030
which shows this is a high probability that you'll win this compared to this one.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.614
It takes into account the probability,

00:01:40.614 --> 00:01:43.159
so you can get a realistic estimate of

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.325
how likely are we getting this amount versus the amount.

00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:49.880
So, this is a bottoms-up sales forecast.

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:52.519
As you can see, here we're using

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:59.929
an opportunity level forecast to project out the bookings for the whole company.
