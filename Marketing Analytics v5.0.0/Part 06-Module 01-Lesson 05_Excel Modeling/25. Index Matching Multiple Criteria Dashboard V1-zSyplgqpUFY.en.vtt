00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.209
So, in our data, since we have two rows for a company at least,

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:08.879
we have Year 1 and Year 2 data,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.850
we are in a pickle if you just try to use match with one criteria,

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.664
because when we get to this,

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:21.875
it's trying to match two criteria both the ticker symbol and the Year 1.

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:25.940
So, this is where we will use Match with two criteria.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.620
For doing this, the Match function in Excel uses Boolean logic.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.759
If you're familiar with Boolean logic this will be straightforward.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:37.673
Using Boolean logic, we can assign a variable,

00:00:37.673 --> 00:00:42.259
a value of 1 when a particular condition is true and

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:47.614
the variable is assigned a value of 0 if the condition is not met.

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:50.090
So, let's first tackle the Boolean logic here.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.700
We can see that the ticker symbol AVGO is true in the case of cell 1 and

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.665
cell 2 which corresponds to the ticker symbol AVGO and the ticker symbol column here.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:10.069
The value of Year 1 is true in the case of cell 1 or row 1,

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.094
3, 5, and 8.

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:18.269
But we want the condition of both ticker symbol AVGO and the

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:24.625
Year 1 to be true which happens to be only in the case of row 1.

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:28.359
So, this is when both the criteria are met.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:35.530
So, I have indicated here with the true and false as well that these two are true.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.534
But these are true in these rows,

00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:45.504
but the combination of the two conditions is true only in this one, the first one,

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:52.944
and this is the value that we want to pull out here and then for Year 2,

00:01:52.944 --> 00:01:54.469
where the condition is met,

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.400
we'll have to pull it out here.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.810
So, we're saying match the condition when the value is 1.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.439
So, we want both the conditions ticker symbol,

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.194
AVGO to be met,

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:09.344
which is row 1 as we know,

00:02:09.344 --> 00:02:13.669
and we want the second Year 1 value to be matched as well.

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.509
So, only when both of these conditions are one,

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:21.139
meet that condition exactly using,

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:25.439
that's where the match type is zero and give us the location.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.495
So, when we do this,

00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:29.384
we see that the value is 1.

00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:35.209
We want to plugin this particular value in the index function and say,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:43.110
"Give me the cost of revenue from the cost of revenue array when the row number is 1."

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.695
So, I can show you this to be true.

00:02:45.694 --> 00:02:47.944
I'm going to go back and actually put

00:02:47.944 --> 00:02:51.519
this code here and you can actually see the formula.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.240
We're making both the condition to be true.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.115
What it does is, Excel does in the background is it calculates the, okay,

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:07.070
when H1 equal to ticker symbol and it does the Boolean logic

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.155
behind times when is a Boolean logic true for the years.

00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:16.400
Multiply both of those conditions because it's assigning a value of 1 for

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.885
every true condition and 0 when the condition isn't met.

00:03:21.884 --> 00:03:25.215
So, it's multiplying both of those and it's giving

00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:30.224
this final array and when this condition is met.

00:03:30.224 --> 00:03:31.769
So, it's saying, "Okay.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.965
One match this condition exactly in the first location."

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:40.520
So, it gives us back the number 1.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.980
That is how you get the value for and total revenue.

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:49.549
We can repeat the process for all of her cells.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.045
You have to type it in by hand, let me do that.

00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:54.649
So, we have total revenue,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.110
match it to the ticker symbol and to the F6 is year,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.770
give me the total revenue value when those conditions are met.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.689
That's how you get the dashboard.

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.650
You can see that this is an interactive dashboard

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.960
because when you change the ticker symbol the value change.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.704
It's showing up as NA in the case of Year 3 because as you,

00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:20.939
let me show you this actual data.

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:26.285
As you can see, there's no Year 3 value except in the case of the HPE.

00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:30.160
So, when you actually look at HPE,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.865
that's when those values show up correctly.

00:04:32.865 --> 00:04:36.930
That's how you do a dashboard using index and matching.
