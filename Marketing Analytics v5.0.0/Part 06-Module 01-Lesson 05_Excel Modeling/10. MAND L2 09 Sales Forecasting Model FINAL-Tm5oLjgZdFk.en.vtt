00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.815
We will next focus on sales forecasting.

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:11.324
We will go through an example of forecasting sales bookings

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:15.629
using both the bottom-up approach and the top-down approach.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.414
In the bottom-up approach,

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:21.179
you will see how historical data is used for forecasting.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.068
In the top-down approach,

00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:26.114
you will use assumptions about [inaudible] that

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:31.125
influences sales productivity and in turn the projected bookings.

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:34.820
Though there are many ways to implement each of these approaches,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.829
the examples here will provide a foundation

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.159
for extending these practices to new examples.

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.669
I've provided additional resources below

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.480
the videos for you to see other examples of sales forecast.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.224
Before we begin, let's take a moment to revisit the sales funnel.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:57.920
As you remember, the sales metrics are tracking the conversions from prospects into

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.439
leads and then turning these leads into quantified leads and finally,

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.759
the hope to win or close the deals and increase the sales bookings.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.125
Now let's go over a sales forecast using a bottom-up approach.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:17.959
This is the more common approach and it comes from the sales funnel historical data.
