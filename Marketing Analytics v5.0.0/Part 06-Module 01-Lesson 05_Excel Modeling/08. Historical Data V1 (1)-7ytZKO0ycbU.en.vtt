00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
Historical data is above what's your metric show for the past.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.970
So, for sales, we look at prior sales data from the last year or month.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.540
For financial modeling, we look at

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.375
prior financial statements quarterly or annual results.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.920
Here is an example of a financial model.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.485
We're using these primers data on revenue and COGS to calculate our operating income.

00:00:24.484 --> 00:00:29.780
We then use our historical data to calculate our assumptions.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.940
Similarly for sales forecasting,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.510
we use our prior months' data on bookings closed in one probability,

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:43.869
and these inputs are used to forecast out our future bookings.
