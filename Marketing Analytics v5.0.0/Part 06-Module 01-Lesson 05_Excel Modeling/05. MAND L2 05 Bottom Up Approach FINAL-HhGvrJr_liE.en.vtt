00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:09.029
A bottom-up approach takes a micro approach to forecasting.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.314
The approach starts by looking at historical data.

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:14.774
The more data you have the better,

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:20.234
but often even as little as six months to one year data is used in this approach.

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:25.410
The model forecasts are based on these data to make assumptions about how

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.469
the key metrics will behave and then we

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:32.009
forecast out the revenue based on these assumptions.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.314
Let's look at a sample income statement that uses

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:39.964
bottom-up approach to forecast out revenues and net income.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:43.190
For instance, we started with the historical data.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:46.864
For example last year's income statement metrics.

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:50.450
Then we use these historical numbers to calculate out

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.240
margin metrics as well as historical income tax rates and interest expenses.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.210
The next step is to use those margins and

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.000
metrics to come up with the assumptions for the future.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.385
In this case, the following year.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:07.940
Finally, using those assumptions in our model,

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.569
we forecast out the key metrics for next year.

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:16.804
As you can see bottom-up approach is based on assumptions as well.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.940
But it is built on previously attained numbers.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.259
They are specific to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.265
how the company has performed and not generalizations

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:28.260
that relate to the market as a whole.
