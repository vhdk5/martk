00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.259
Modeling refers to using certain inputs and using those inputs to

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.605
predict and forecast how our desired business metric will perform in the future.

00:00:11.605 --> 00:00:17.750
How far out you forecast really depends on the type of company you have.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.300
Startups usually forecast six months to a year out,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.679
while most established companies forecast out a few years.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.005
It can also depend on the metric,

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:34.605
for example, sales bookings,

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:36.884
maybe for a few months out.

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:41.604
Models are continuously updated on an ongoing basis,

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:46.729
monthly, quarterly, annually, depending on the metric.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.225
Most businesses forecast the sales bookings and financial statements.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:57.125
Typically, businesses forecast all three financial statements,

00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:58.490
profit and loss statement,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.969
cash flow statement, and balance sheet.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.679
However, in this lesson,

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.659
we will focus on the profit and loss statement.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.920
We have provided some website links that go over

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.564
how to forecast the other two financial statements,

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:16.864
as it requires more specialized knowledge of finance and accounting.

00:01:16.864 --> 00:01:20.344
In the next video, we will go over two approaches to modeling,

00:01:20.344 --> 00:01:24.969
top-down and bottom-up approach. See you in the next video.
