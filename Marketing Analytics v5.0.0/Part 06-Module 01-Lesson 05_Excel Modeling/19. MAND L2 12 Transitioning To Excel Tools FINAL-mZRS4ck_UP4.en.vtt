00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:06.919
To build on the financial model,

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.099
let's first take a look at some Excel functions and tools for financial modeling.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.859
As we introduce you to each of these,

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.839
we will work toward the financial model.

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.695
So this will set you up nicely for your final project.

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:23.829
Data validation is an Excel tool that

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.445
allows you to limit what values are accepted in a cell.

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:30.355
You can create drop-down list of items,

00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:34.524
restrict cell value to data ranges and numbers.

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:40.149
Index function is used when you want the cell to have a value chosen from

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.619
a specified array and row number indicated within the index function.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:50.269
Match is the lookup function that can locate the position of the lookup value

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.240
within an array only when it needs specific criteria defined in the match function.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.609
Index and match together add a powerful feature for advanced formulas.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.625
Together they can give a value from an array,

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:07.370
the purpose of the index function based on

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.180
a numeric position which is provided by the match function.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.055
Finally, offset.

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:17.180
Here you can select a start point in the spreadsheet and tell

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.530
Excel to return a set of styles that are counted from the starting point.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.790
We are going to work through an actual example for each of these in the coming videos.
