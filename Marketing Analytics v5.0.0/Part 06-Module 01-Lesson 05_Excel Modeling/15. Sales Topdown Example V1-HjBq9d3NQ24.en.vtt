00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.665
So, let's walk through the model.

00:00:01.665 --> 00:00:04.339
I've kept the overarching themes here on the left.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.605
So, you can see what is the motivation for each of these sections.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:12.675
We start with the number of opportunities we expect the person to close annually.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:19.289
Average price per unit is the average price per unit or product for manufacturing.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.259
If you work in a sales SaaS company,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.020
this would be the average price per seat.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.839
Average units per opportunity is the average number of

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.125
units you can expect to sell per opportunity.

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:34.740
Average contracts month per opportunity is the average length

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.370
of time in months that sales contract can be for.

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:41.579
Next, we get to the average opportunity size.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.299
You just take the product of these three numbers,

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.189
average price per unit,

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:49.729
average units per opportunity and average

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.704
contract months per opportunity to get this number of bookings.

00:00:53.704 --> 00:01:00.484
This is the average booking size we expect this salesperson to create on an annual basis.

00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:05.284
Next, we see how we are going to get to these booking sites.

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:10.789
We start with the assumption that the center ramp or the length of time we can

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.865
expect the new seller to reach full productivity after being hired is three months.

00:01:16.864 --> 00:01:21.140
So, we have the projector and hire date here and we use dummy coding.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.370
Dummy coding refers to when you give a value of zero or one to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.540
a sale because it means something's got to represent something has happened.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.800
It's kind of one and zero are dummies for the presence of something happening.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.825
So, in the sales hiring schedule,

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:42.125
we're trying to create dummy coding for the projected hire date and after that,

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:46.219
indicating a one for the person having been hired.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.209
For this, we use two XOR functions.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.479
One is end of month and the other is today. Let's start with today.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.760
So, for sales person one, say,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.850
we are going to hire them on 12/16.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.419
So, we start with the today function just says okay.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.075
Whatever today's date is,

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:05.924
just add 30 days to it.

00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:08.069
Well, since I'm doing the recording on 11/16,

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.044
it is just adding 30 days to that and so on.

00:02:12.044 --> 00:02:16.459
Here, we're adding 60 days to it and here we are adding 90 days to it.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.300
End of month allows you to state that today date

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.750
and add months to that date and give that final date.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.509
So, today's date is 11/16 and is adding

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:32.780
zero months to it but it's giving me the end of the month, which is 11/30.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.460
It does the same thing,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.365
giving it a one-month laps,

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:39.170
two-month laps and a three-month laps.

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:43.549
So, now we can see that the hiring schedule shows that once a person has hired,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.795
a month from then,

00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:49.444
they will be employed and available to start generating leads,

00:02:49.444 --> 00:02:51.169
and that's what this table is showing.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.405
For the center productivity schedule,

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:56.210
we borrow the end of month function again and get

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.330
three months for every month from today.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.555
So, because we are trying to generate

00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:05.960
the schedule when the seller is going to be productive,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.905
we want to give the seller three months of ramp time.

00:03:09.905 --> 00:03:12.020
So, starting from today,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.344
end of the month of today's month,

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:16.560
just add three months to that.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.555
So, that's what end of month does here.

00:03:18.555 --> 00:03:21.750
We're just giving it C14,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.104
which is this month,

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:27.674
this date here and it's adding three months to that,

00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:30.920
same here and use the dummy coding to create

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.929
the productivity schedule that shows three months since the person was hired,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.780
the person is going to be productive or not.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.995
This matrix describes the productive discussion.

00:03:41.995 --> 00:03:45.194
Finally, we get to our projections for when a seller

00:03:45.194 --> 00:03:48.530
will be productive and the projected bookings based on that.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.150
Since we only need the bookings the seller will generate per month,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.090
we're trying to calculate that dollar amount per month.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.034
We need to multiply the productivity dummy variable,

00:04:00.034 --> 00:04:05.764
here with the projected average booking that we expect based on this number.

00:04:05.764 --> 00:04:07.384
So, let me break that down.

00:04:07.384 --> 00:04:10.344
So, this is telling us that,

00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:13.125
start with this booking number,

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:16.879
130,000 per person times

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:21.189
the number of opportunities the person will be generating per month,

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:25.464
that's this number, and multiply that with this value,

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:27.619
which is whether the person is productive or not.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.639
So, it generates that projected booking per person for

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.469
that month based on this and then we can get our total bookings at the bottom.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.170
I made a copy of the CSV,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.944
so you can look at the CSV file yourself too.

00:04:40.944 --> 00:04:43.375
Feel free to watch this video again,

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:47.670
slowly, as you follow along with the file on your computer.
