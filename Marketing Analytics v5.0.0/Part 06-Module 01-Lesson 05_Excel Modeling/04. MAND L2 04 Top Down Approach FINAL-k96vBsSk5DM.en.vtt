00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.320
Forecasting model requires careful thinking

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.605
about which approach you want take to create the models.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:13.455
One approach to modeling is top-down,

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:16.050
it takes a macro approach to forecasting.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.100
Here you start with the best estimate of the larger size of the market,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.960
narrowing down to identify the portion of the market that the company is serving,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.940
and then estimate what it will take to capture that portion of the market.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.505
Top-down is a macro approach,

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:37.315
but it's less credible and typically adopted when there's limited historical data.

00:00:37.314 --> 00:00:42.679
We'll next look at an example that shows why this is less credible.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.200
Let's go to the WeCart example.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.969
We start with the online grocery delivery market which is about $20 billion,

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.615
and then we start getting into the specifics such as

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.945
which market segments the company wants to focus on.

00:00:56.945 --> 00:01:00.950
Say the executive team at WeCart wants to retain the focus

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.109
on the urban market which is about $17 million.

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:10.664
Now, the assumption is that WeCart aim to capture five percent of this market,

00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:14.775
and with that we arrived at $850,000.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:17.550
Finally, based on our product pricing,

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.054
say $4.95 per delivery,

00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:25.885
we can now arrive at our sale quantity estimates of about 170,000 customer orders.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:29.990
As you can see, this is a less credible way to forecast because

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:34.069
you're talking in guesses and estimates based on macro figures.

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.829
It's harder to convince potential investors you

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.679
can realistically achieve this forecasted revenue.
