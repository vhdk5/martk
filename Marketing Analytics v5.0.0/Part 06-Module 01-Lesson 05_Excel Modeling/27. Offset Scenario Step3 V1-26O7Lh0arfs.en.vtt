00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
Now, we get to step three.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.310
We want the values here in the assumptions to

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:09.480
change depending on which scenario we choose.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.109
We don't want to hardcore them by selecting only the strong case for revenue growth,

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.000
gross margin, and operating margin.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.545
So, now we're looking for a way to tell Excel to use this cell,

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:28.910
in this row and this column when the scenario is a strong case scenario,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.500
and use the cell in this row and this column when

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.810
the scenario chosen is a base case and change it to this.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.090
This is where offset can be used,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.020
and here is what the generic function isn't looking for.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.480
So, it's looking for a reference point,

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.369
some place to start with,

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:54.679
and then it's asking for how many rows do you want me to move over,

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.539
and how many columns?

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.714
Based on that, that is the value I'll return in this particular cell.

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:06.140
Okay, and so for the rules I want

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.540
it to be able to move to the right row and give me this value.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.770
I'm actually going to go ahead and use the match function to

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:21.079
match the row based on the scenario that is chosen here.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.150
So, that just kind of a criteria that we're using and the scenario,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.370
and so therefore I'm going to use the match function to narrow

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.329
down which row I am selecting.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.274
For the which row am I selecting this one,

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:38.109
this one or this one.

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.200
This one, this one and this one.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.010
Then the column I can tell is the one over here,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.270
or the one over here.

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:50.149
So, I'm going to switch over to this tab here because

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.090
you can see that I'm using this reference point.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.120
So, offset is always looking for a starting point.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.500
So, that's what you do.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.189
So when you're actually plugging in the opposite function,

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.659
it's starting a reference.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.655
Reference is the starting point from which to count the number of rows and columns.

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:09.905
So, I want in here,

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:17.189
I want the reference point to be let's say this because I'm talking about revenue growth,

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.780
so I have this empty cell.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.099
So, I'm going to just use this as my starting point and say okay,

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.639
go down to this row and this column.

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.139
So, I'm going to show you this.

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.974
So, I'm saying okay,

00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:30.989
start with this reference point,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.835
blue border cell here,

00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:35.250
and match for the row,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.634
match whatever is in.

00:02:37.634 --> 00:02:42.179
So, matched function will return for me the row that I'm looking for,

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:47.128
which will be C24 because it's looking for this scenario,

00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:50.745
matching it within this lookup array,

00:02:50.745 --> 00:02:55.640
and saying strong case matches the row one of these three cases,

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.919
and so it's going to return the value.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.740
I'm asking it for an exact match,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.100
that's why I have the match type to be zero.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.780
So, it's going to say, okay match row is one, and then column.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.219
So, now I have the match giving me back row is one,

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.879
and now for this is the column reference.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:23.914
So, I'm saying okay, stay in this column which belongs to H28 and give me this cell.

00:03:23.914 --> 00:03:28.000
So, if it says base case,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.430
match will give me back two because off

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.900
the lookup array it'll give me the second row for the first year,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.375
or rather for year four.

00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:41.909
So, when I again, Control, Alt, Shift,

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.990
it gives me minus five,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.665
which is this case because right now scenario is selected as base case.

00:03:48.664 --> 00:03:50.854
If I change it to a strong case,

00:03:50.854 --> 00:03:52.909
then it switches to minus three.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.715
So, for this one,

00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:58.215
well it's one column of H28.

00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:02.009
So, staying with the same reference point,

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.715
I'm saying H28 is the reference cell,

00:04:05.715 --> 00:04:09.280
match it to the same criteria, strong,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.939
the scenario criteria and give me an exact match for that row.

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:15.875
Then for column I'm saying,

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:18.785
offset move over one column.

00:04:18.785 --> 00:04:20.660
That's this column here.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.370
So, it's going to give me minus three.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.254
Let me show you how it changes.

00:04:25.254 --> 00:04:27.194
So, if I say this is minus four,

00:04:27.194 --> 00:04:29.204
this value changes to minus four.

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:33.404
So, that's how offset and match are used.

00:04:33.404 --> 00:04:35.613
So, for gross margin,

00:04:35.613 --> 00:04:40.774
the only difference is I'm using the same offset and match combination,

00:04:40.774 --> 00:04:46.579
but this time I decided to use this empty cell right above gross margin,

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:50.589
but in essence it's the same exact principle that I'm saying, okay,

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:53.639
for match row H32,

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.800
match it for me for C24 in this lookup array.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.290
That's what the B33, B35 is.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.680
You can see in the purple colored cells,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.775
give me an exact match of that row.

00:05:05.774 --> 00:05:08.664
So, this gives me back row one, two, or three,

00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:13.175
based on whatever is inside this scenario strong scenario here.

00:05:13.175 --> 00:05:17.090
Give me just the column the first with still within the same column

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:21.419
as H32 for year four and for year five,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.340
just move by a column.

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.379
So again, I'm just going to demonstrate.

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.629
So, if I change this to well,

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:28.839
survey in the strong case,

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.935
so I'm going to change this to 0.32.

00:05:31.935 --> 00:05:33.625
It changes to 32.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.300
This is set up to be 32 percent to

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.754
a percentage but I just wanted to be a value, number value.

00:05:40.754 --> 00:05:47.269
So, that is how I repeated it for operating margin and using H36 as a reference point,

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:50.629
and we get our assumptions and they are dynamic.

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.125
We're finally ready for step four,

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:55.600
which is the next video.
