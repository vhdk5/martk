00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
Let's say you're the sales manager for a company that makes flatware,

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.118
say using renewable products like bamboo,

00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:08.835
and you've been asked to forecast the sales for the company.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:14.330
Your sales team has several accounts which offer opportunities to make a sales deals,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.894
and you're trying to forecast your sales metrics for the next year.

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:22.335
Account refers to the companies where you provide your products in bulk.

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:24.990
You're not selling to the individual customer here,

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.709
but rather to the company that will buy the products in bulk.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.954
Now, let's go over sales forecast example using a bottom-up approach.

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:37.500
This is the more common approach and it comes from the sales file historical data.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.969
We start with having one row for each person in our sales team.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.460
So, in the model,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.465
we are trying to understand for each person in our sales team,

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:49.920
which account is this opportunity with?

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.365
How many units is this opportunity likely to create a booking for or sale?

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:58.675
Based on how long the sales contract would be for,

00:00:58.674 --> 00:01:01.579
what are the sales that we would generate if

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.819
these units were sold each month in the contract term?

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.549
That provides us with our bookings forecast.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.299
In column F, we can go one step further and we can

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.590
ask how likely is the probability of a win for this opportunity?

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.680
Based on that probability,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.400
we can calculate the weighted bookings forecast.
