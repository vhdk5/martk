00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Let's go over a top-down model that focuses on bookings for salesperson.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.394
The model is divided into four portions here.

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:11.539
We're starting with an assumptions about the dollar amount we need in bookings.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.009
Then we figure out how much time and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.114
effort it will require to get to generate those bookings.

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:18.719
Let's look at this more closely.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.579
We start with our assumption about

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.199
how productive this salesperson who we're going to higher will be.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.570
We measure this in terms of the number of opportunities being generated,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.840
and then we look at how much revenue on average will

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.320
this person generate per unit and per opportunity.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.990
We use these assumptions to arrive at

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.730
the average size of opportunity we can expect the salesperson to generate.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.339
Then we make assumptions about how much time and

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.415
effort it will take us to arrive at those bookings.

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:52.679
For this, we project out when we will hire the person.

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.130
Then based on our sales historical data,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.225
we come up with the assumption that our new sales member will take

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:04.579
X number of months to get up to speed to start generating those leads and bookings.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.959
Then finally, we use the ramp time and the average size of

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:12.109
opportunity assumptions to project out when we

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:15.319
will see the bookings that we expect this person to generate.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.694
As you can see, we get to the final bookings number for

00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:24.509
each sales team member and month by starting with our bookings in the more broad sense,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.800
and then narrowing down to each person and month.
