Welcome to this lesson on Excel Modeling.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.300
This lesson will build nicely on the business metric lesson.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.455
Now that you know how to calculate and interpret a business metric,

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:19.549
you can start forecasting the key metrics.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.440

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.660
you will understand the fundamentals of sales and financial forecasting models.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.384
This lesson will prepare you nicely for the project at the end of the lesson.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:35.750
The project will have you use actual S&amp;P 500 data from

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.155
the New York Stock Exchange to forecast out a P&amp;L statement for a company of your choice.

00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:47.000
The data will include financial performance data from over 500 companies.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.439
By the end of the course,

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:50.449
you will have mastered how to use

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.400
advanced Excel tools and this set you up nicely for completing the project.
