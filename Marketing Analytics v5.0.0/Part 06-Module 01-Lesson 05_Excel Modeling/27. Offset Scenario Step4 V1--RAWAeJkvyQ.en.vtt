00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.429
So, finally we're at the last step in the financial forecasting process.

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:11.899
Here, I've created the equations for you so you can see what I'm doing for year four,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.594
year five, and we start plugging in the values from the assumptions.

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:23.549
So, this one is year four revenue will be based off of year three's revenue,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.750
so it's just going to add whatever the assumption here above revenue growth.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.899
So, you just say,

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:36.210
G7 which is previous year's revenue times one plus the revenue growth percent expected.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.140
So, you add that and you get this value,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.715
so you can, let's just see.

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:41.990
So, it's taking this year,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.980
year three's revenue times one plus minus three,

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.544
and that's the reason why it's actually going down.

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:51.515
For year five, it's doing the same thing.

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:54.554
You just a reference into year four instead.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:59.100
So that's why the H7 and we're basing it off I19.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.814
So, see that here, okay.

00:01:01.814 --> 00:01:04.043
Then for gross margins,

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:07.295
we are forecasting it based off of the revenue,

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:11.015
so we just take whatever the revenue is for year four

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:15.385
times the gross margin and for F column,

00:01:15.385 --> 00:01:18.140
so it's just multiplying this revenue with

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.260
gross margin and that gives us the gross profit.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.660
Similarly here, it's just year five's revenue times the gross margin of this,

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.439
all of this formula is here so you can keep referencing to that.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:39.664
H7 which is revenue times the operating margin for year four and for year five.

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.820
So, now we can see that our financial forecast is based off

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.049
the historical data for this company but also the assumptions that we make,

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.989
and as described earlier as we change

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:55.694
the scenario analysis the forecast to the metrics change as well.

00:01:55.694 --> 00:02:03.119
So now, we have a dynamic representation of our financial forecast based on scenarios.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.210
So, that's called scenario analysis as well,

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.919
it's one way to create a financial forecast using some advanced Excel tools.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.530
I've provided the formulas that I've used below

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.729
and you can also find them in the CSV file in the resource.

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:17.729
I hope you find this video helpful.
