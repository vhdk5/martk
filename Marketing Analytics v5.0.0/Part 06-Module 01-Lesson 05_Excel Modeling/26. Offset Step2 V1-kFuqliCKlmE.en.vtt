00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.084
So, now we're going to cover step two.

00:00:02.084 --> 00:00:06.945
We're creating the three scenarios for each of our operating statistics,

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:11.475
because eventually these will feed into the forecast above.

00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:14.339
We've created row for each of

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.429
these three scenarios and the actual numbers are based on historical data,

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.265
which we know as here,

00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:23.565
knowledge of the business autonomous,

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.775
research, and assumptions about the business itself.

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:28.754
You would be asking questions like,

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:33.494
do you expect the revenue growth to stay the same or increase?

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:35.114
If so, by how much?

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:36.780
Let's walk through each of these,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.329
base case is the status quo.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.114
So, we can plug this in.

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:46.079
So, the average growth was minus six percent.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.049
So, you can see that in year two the revenues were lower than year one,

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.229
and then they were even further lower in year three.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.489
So, this company isn't doing well.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.405
So, the revenue growth was minus six percent off of year one,

00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:06.614
and minus four percent off of year two.

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:12.719
So, the base case is to just keep the status quo and keep it an average of minus five.

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.989
The strong case is that you actually reduce this decline and you say,

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:20.484
okay it's going to be minus three.

00:01:20.484 --> 00:01:23.935
The weak case is where it becomes worse.

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:26.310
So, just for simplicity reason,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.405
just kept this as minus seven to just show you.

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:34.070
For gross margin, we can see that the gross margin,

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.964
we can see has been 0.28 to 0.29.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:47.270
So, I'm going to keep this as the base case and then prove it by a percentage 0.02 here.

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:51.274
Then, the weak case would be where it declined a little bit.

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:55.670
Again, this will be based on more about the assumptions about

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.079
the company and having a better business knowledge about the company itself.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.198
Then finally for operating margin,

00:02:03.198 --> 00:02:06.890
it was 0.07 through 0.05,

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.060
it ranged in that.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.335
So, I'm going to keep it at an average of base cases 0.06,

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:15.349
strongest 0.08 and 0.09,

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.099
and then weak cases 0.07 and we'll just keep it there.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.229
So, we have our scenarios mapped out now and we get to step three.

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:29.929
I'm just going to pause here and we can watch the next step in the next video.
