There are essentially two parts to a model; inputs and output.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:11.759
You need the inputs to create a model or drivers of the model.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.015
The output is what you're aiming to forecast.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.460
The golden forecasting is to find

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.245
a related inputs which can help you best predict your key outputs.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:26.700
Typically, for inputs, we could include a combination of historical data,

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.474
assumptions, and scenario analysis.

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:33.550
Let's go through each of these in the next set of videos.
