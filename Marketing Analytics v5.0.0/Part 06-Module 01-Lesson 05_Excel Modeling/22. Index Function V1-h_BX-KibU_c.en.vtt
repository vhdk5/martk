00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.205
Now let's see a simple example.

00:00:02.205 --> 00:00:04.800
I have already created the named array for

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.695
the cells to correspond with the column headers.

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:12.120
So, here we have year in the name box,

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.838
we have total revenue, cost of revenue,

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.105
SGAs, R and D,

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:20.010
and other operating items.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.525
As part of index,

00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:22.904
this is what I want to do.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:28.695
I want to be able to pull for this particular ticker symbol,

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.620
the appropriate total revenue,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.048
cost of revenue, SGA,

00:00:34.048 --> 00:00:37.274
R and D, and other operating items for year one.

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:39.134
So, it shows up like this.

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:42.750
So, keep in mind this is horizontal.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.340
It's the very first row.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.755
Each row indicating a different item in the financial statement,

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:52.145
but we want to convert it to a vertical array.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:54.730
So, how do we go about doing that?

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.349
So, I've placed all the formulas here so you can follow me along,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.439
and this is how we use the index.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:05.750
We've already defined the array from which we want to pull the values.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.750
This is how we want to be if we wanted,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.644
from this array, you want the very first value.

00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:14.899
From this array, we want the very first value to be

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.190
pulled into each of these cells. So, this is how you do it.

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.804
So, you'll say equal index.

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:25.685
One way to do it is to select the array,

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:30.265
but keep in mind that I've actually already named it.

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:33.549
So, I'm going to actually just call it up.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.454
So, the way to call it up is you say, total.

00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:38.099
So, you start typing in the word,

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:40.184
and it shows up with this icon.

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:41.460
You can select that,

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.609
and it puts that in the array parameter.

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.025
Then for row number,

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:47.935
we just want the very first row.

00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:50.379
We don't have a column specification,

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:52.409
so because it's one array,

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.659
we're going to say one for the row number,

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.474
and we close the bracket.

00:01:56.474 --> 00:01:59.219
Keep in mind there's one final step.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.310
You have to Control, Shift,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.200
and Enter on the PC,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.710
and it puts the value in.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:10.280
I repeat the same for the rest of the cells.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.330
I start typing cost of revenue, one,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.430
and I press Control, Shift,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.610
Enter, and I believe it's the same on the mark.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.510
Index, gross, this is actually going to be

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:28.789
our formula because this is revenue minus COGS,

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:33.004
and it's blue because I prepopulated the blue format,

00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:35.674
because it's a calculation we're doing here.

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:39.710
Then here, I do index SGA.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.335
I can select it from my name box,

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:44.879
one, Control Shift Enter,

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.264
and I keep going on to the other row,

00:02:47.264 --> 00:02:49.844
which is the other operating expenses,

00:02:49.844 --> 00:02:52.409
and finally to chip direct.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.449
For the total operating expenses,

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.639
I just add up these three,

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:03.634
and operating income is gross profit minus the total operating expenses,

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:06.905
which gives us the operating income, or EBIT.

00:03:06.905 --> 00:03:10.199
So, this is how you do an index function.
