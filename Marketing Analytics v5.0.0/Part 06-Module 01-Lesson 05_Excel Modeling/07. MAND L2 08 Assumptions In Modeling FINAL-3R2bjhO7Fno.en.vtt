00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.410
In modeling, assumptions are what you think will come

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.365
true for the input or metrics in the model.

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:15.705
It can be assumptions about the circumstances that affect the metrics in the model.

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:17.579
To build your assumptions out,

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.899
you start with information available to you based on historical data.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.679
For example, we can assume we will continue to gain

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.879
market share at the same rate as we have for the last six months,

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:34.214
or we assume that we will continue to see spikes in sales,

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:37.620
or on holidays, or on certain days of the week.

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:39.539
As you make assumptions,

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.104
pay attention to your forecasts about metrics you have less control over.

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:47.884
Costs are usually harder to change drastically.

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:52.070
So when you make your assumptions about reducing the future costs,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.960
make sure you're being realistic.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.590
For instance, when estimating the cost of delivery,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.795
the cost of gas is typically harder to predict since gas prices are fairly volatile.

00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:08.180
So, in general, be careful about the assumptions you make about changes in

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.310
costs and check to see if those assumptions are reasonable and makes sense.
