00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.060
So you might be asking yourself,

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:07.964
why then this lesson cover?

00:00:07.964 --> 00:00:10.919
First, we will start with a brief introduction to

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.625
fundamental ideas used in creating forecasting models.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:19.785
We will review the two approaches to modeling; top-down and bottom-up.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.760
You will learn about inputs and outputs of

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.080
the model and the types of inputs required to create models.

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.559
We will practice Excel functions and tools that can

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.189
make forecasting models easier and interactive.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:37.594
You will learn advanced tools like index, match,

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:41.719
and offset that can come in handy during scenario analysis.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.299
I'm so excited to show you the ins and outs of

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:48.449
modeling techniques in Excel. So let's dig in.
