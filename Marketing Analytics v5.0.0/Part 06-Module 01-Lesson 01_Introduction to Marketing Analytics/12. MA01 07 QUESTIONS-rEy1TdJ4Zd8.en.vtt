00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.884
We've established that the marketing landscape is complex.

00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:09.089
We have data being collected and delivered through a vast ecosystem of platform.

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:14.550
We can combine this data layering it and segmenting it to answer our key questions.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.660
Additionally, we have a process by which we can look at the analytics,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.710
and we even have a methodology by how we analyze these insights.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.210
Now, we're always looking to capture the right data based on

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.310
our objectives and figuring out

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.089
the insights that we specifically need to get out of this data.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.720
But when it comes time to actually start pulling these metrics,

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.339
it can be confusing to know how much data you need to answer your question.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.125
So I encourage you to approach

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:46.725
every analytics project so that you can answer these five questions.

00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:49.125
First, what happened?

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:52.950
Are we looking at a data point or multiple data points.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.225
We're usually looking at this data in comparison to something.

00:00:56.225 --> 00:01:00.590
So oftentimes, we'll see that the trend is up or a trend is down,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.275
and that'll indicate that something has happened.

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:05.274
Then we need to ask ourselves,

00:01:05.274 --> 00:01:07.085
are these results good?

00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:10.254
Now we talked a little about how we evaluate this,

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:15.909
change and context help us understand if this is normal or abnormal.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.619
Once we've identified that,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.660
we need to understand why did it happen,

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.049
and this is where it gets really complex.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.534
Now we're being a detective.

00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:28.554
There are many ways that can contribute to why something happened.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.384
Lots of data to discover,

00:01:30.384 --> 00:01:33.715
to figure out what went wrong or what went right.

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:38.980
It's also important that we be careful between causation and correlation because

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.545
oftentimes we can compare the wrong data

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:45.500
or the right data and get drastically different answers.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.545
Next, we need to figure out what's happening now.

00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:53.420
Right, we want to figure out if this trend is continuing or if

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.500
this event happened one time or if it's going to keep happening.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.750
Finally, what will happen in the future.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.310
Remember, we're always thinking about actionability.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.260
So what's going to happen if we don't change

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.259
things or what will happen if we change things.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.844
Again, some things are going to be one time occurrences.

00:02:12.844 --> 00:02:16.430
Other events might be the start of growth or decline.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.920
Now, when we think about the future,

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.699
we can start forecasting by manipulating the data.

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.054
Let's think about this a different way.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:26.659
Say you're asked to review

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.259
the sales performance of your e-commerce store from last Friday.

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.439
So what happened? Let's say we had 30 sales.

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.645
Okay. Are these results good?

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:40.550
Well, we need to figure out if this particular measurement is good or bad,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.635
which means we have to compare it.

00:02:42.634 --> 00:02:46.849
So we'll use that historical dataset or even benchmarks that already

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.264
exist to determine whether what we have is good or bad.

00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:56.734
Again, I like to use the change and contexts within that select time period.

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:59.000
So let's say we look at change.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.189
We identify that this is a 50 percent lift from last Friday.

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.710
What's the context then,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.070
is this normal or abnormal?

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.875
Well, we have to think about this.

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:13.085
It could be good or it could be bad.

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:14.980
Is there seasonality involved?

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.429
Let's say today is a holiday.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.909
So a 50 percent lift from last Friday can actually be

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.305
bad if we should have expected 150 percent lift.

00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:26.810
So now we need to figure out why it happened.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.045
Let's say it ends up being a good thing.

00:03:29.044 --> 00:03:30.799
Are we running a promotion?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.810
Is that promotion what contributed,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.650
or did more traffic come to the site?

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.780
Was there a blog mentioned somewhere on the web?

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.585
You have to connect all the dots.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:43.040
We need to identify where this lift came from because that

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:47.914
will help us figure out later what we do when we forecast into the future.

00:03:47.914 --> 00:03:50.164
So what's happening right now?

00:03:50.164 --> 00:03:54.215
Well, we look at this and we say sales are still up,

00:03:54.215 --> 00:03:57.265
and relative to what we typically see.

00:03:57.264 --> 00:04:01.759
By knowing that what's happening now follows a positive trend,

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:05.574
we're less concerned than if it was following a negative trend.

00:04:05.574 --> 00:04:08.474
Finally, what might happen in the future.

00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:13.194
Well now, we can start to understand if we expect this pattern to continue or not.

00:04:13.194 --> 00:04:14.414
If it was seasonality,

00:04:14.414 --> 00:04:16.459
then we know that this is going to drop off.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.310
If it was a new marketing promotion,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.665
then we might think, well,

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:21.980
if we keep investing this spend,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.335
then we should keep getting these results.

00:04:24.334 --> 00:04:28.039
Now you can plug that data in and start asking great questions.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.830
If we keep spending this much money,

00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:31.639
are we going to keep getting this return,

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.814
and if so, what does that mean for our bottom line?

00:04:33.814 --> 00:04:38.035
Can we spend more money and create more revenue.

00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:41.794
In which case, you start to get into forecasting and projecting,

00:04:41.793 --> 00:04:46.609
and now you start thinking about how you can build actionable insights.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.795
Now we can take action.

00:04:47.795 --> 00:04:49.939
We can say, well, we're going to forecast,

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:52.595
and now we start thinking about hypotheses and testing,

00:04:52.595 --> 00:04:54.660
which we'll get into later.
