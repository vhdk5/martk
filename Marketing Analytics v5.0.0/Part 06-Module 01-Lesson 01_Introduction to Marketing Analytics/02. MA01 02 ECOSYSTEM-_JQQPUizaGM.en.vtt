00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
When we look at the marketing ecosystem,

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:06.720
today's marketer has access to a staggering amount of data,

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:10.558
and the challenge is that you're expected to be able to capture,

00:00:10.558 --> 00:00:13.559
analyze, and report on all of this data,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.435
and it can be overwhelming.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:18.780
A common graphic that gets passed around in the industry is

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.245
this landscape diagram from Chiefmartech.com.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:26.550
Updated in 2018, this super graphic displays

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.740
over 6,800 different marketing technology solutions,

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.509
every new platform, tool,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.539
and data vendor contributes to a digital ecosystem that is beyond mind-boggling.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.350
Now, when we think about marketing analytics,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.539
we often start with the tool that we're most familiar with,

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.539
and then we look at the world of analytics through that lens.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.149
For many of us, that might be Google Analytics.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.935
It's arguably the most popular marketing analytics platform,

00:00:53.935 --> 00:00:57.065
but Google Analytics provides us one view.

00:00:57.064 --> 00:00:59.989
It's primarily looking at our website metrics.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.575
We're seeing things such as how much time people spend on our website,

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:05.075
what pages they look at,

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:08.234
and whether they buy or abandon our site.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:12.025
But Google Analytics can't answer every question,

00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:13.850
and as you saw,

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:16.640
there's clearly enough data solutions out there to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.849
answer just about any question we may have.

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:22.309
So when it comes to analytics,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.875
we have this giant ecosystem by which we can pull all of our insights out of,

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:30.844
but we don't necessarily need all of these tools.

00:01:30.844 --> 00:01:34.340
In fact, we likely only need a fraction of them.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.355
You see this entire ecosystem gives us access to specific answers based on our needs.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:43.910
We can find the one tool that answers the question that we have.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.429
For example, we might use a tool to generate

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.440
heat maps based on user behavior on our website,

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.344
and then we'll capture data from that,

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:55.325
or we might be running ads on a different platform such as AdWords,

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:56.930
Twitter, or maybe Facebook,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.825
and there we can also capture data.

00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:04.100
We may also use a tool to evaluate call volumes at our call center

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:09.069
or maybe a tool specific to measuring keyword ranking in our search results.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.590
Now, all of this data is native to that platform.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.930
So each platform is doing a very specific job and capturing a very specific set of data.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.310
Now, what we can do is we can go to each tool and look at

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.469
that data and perhaps we can pull it down

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.469
manually just like we would do in Google Analytics.

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.849
We could load this data up into various spreadsheets and combine it,

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.609
but the ecosystem also gives us access to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.805
software that automatically aggregates all of that data.

00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:41.000
So we can plug in data from each of these tools and use

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.185
one platform to look at all of that data in combination.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:47.090
This can make our life easier.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.034
So we can use this software to combine our data with

00:02:51.034 --> 00:02:55.460
other people's data to get really rich insights on our metrics.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.235
Like we mentioned earlier, most of that data is

00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:01.760
only going to come from a handful of sources and

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.653
these sources make up part of what we call

00:03:04.653 --> 00:03:08.284
our marketing technology stack or MarTech for short.

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:11.329
Now, the technology that you're going to use will

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.840
typically align to the various parts of the marketing funnel,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.180
and much about what we talked in analytics really refers back to this marketing funnel.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.435
If you remember, the marketing funnel goes Awareness,

00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:27.715
Interest, Desire, Action, and Advocacy.

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:30.439
So some tools cover a lot of the funnel.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.629
Google Analytics is a great example.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.055
It can display data surrounding traffic arriving at the site, top of the funnel,

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:38.680
then engaging on the site,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.569
and then converting on the site there at the bottom of that funnel.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.454
Now, some tools are specific to various areas of the funnel.

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:48.320
With awareness, you might be capturing data out of

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.930
platforms like AdWords, Facebook, or SEMRush.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.775
With an interest and desire,

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:57.735
you might have data coming from WordPress, HubSpot, or Mailchimp.

00:03:57.735 --> 00:04:02.250
For action, well, you might be leveraging Salesforce, Optimizely,

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.610
or Shopify, and then within advocacy,

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.020
well, you might have your own data from your CRM.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.469
What you use is really going to depend on what

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.905
your business goals are within each area of the funnel.

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:17.745
So as you can see,

00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:19.449
we have all of these sources,

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.469
and then we have all of these areas of

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.155
the customer journey that we want to capture data for.

00:04:24.154 --> 00:04:26.629
So we're faced with two challenges.

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:29.240
The first is, where should our data come from?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.384
The second is, how do I use that data?

00:04:32.384 --> 00:04:36.159
Well, there is no one size fits all approach.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.055
You don't really start by picking your data sources.

00:04:39.055 --> 00:04:42.250
You actually start by picking your strategy.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.709
So we can answer that first question of where the data comes from,

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:49.500
by figuring out our objectives.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.480
What does our business do?

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.045
What information helps us do it better?

00:04:54.045 --> 00:04:58.930
Really, we're trying to figure out what happens at each stage of our customer journey,

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.480
and then we need to figure out how to measure

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.450
that so that we can make more informed decisions.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.599
Now, when it comes time to apply the data,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.390
we have to think about the action that we want to take.

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.709
You see, we collect and use data to inform decisions.

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:17.000
So we really need to think about the question we're

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.579
trying to answer or the decision we want to make,

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:21.294
and then work from there.

00:05:21.295 --> 00:05:24.745
So as you can see, the way that you can use this ecosystem,

00:05:24.745 --> 00:05:27.990
can be figured out either top down or bottom up.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.170
Either start with your objective,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.050
and then pinpoint all the data that you'll collect across

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.829
the funnel or start with the question you want to answer,

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:39.779
and figure out what data you need to get that answer.
