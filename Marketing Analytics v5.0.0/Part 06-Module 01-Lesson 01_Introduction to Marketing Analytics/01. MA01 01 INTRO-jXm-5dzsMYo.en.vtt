00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Analytics is something every business requires to stay competitive.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.980
The more information you can use to inform your actions, the better.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.669
Analytics and the techniques to properly use them support

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.740
both strategic marketing decisions such as how much to spend or what a customer is worth,

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.199
and more tactical campaign decisions,

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.594
such as targeting the right customer with the right message at the right time.

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:26.160
No matter what industry you're business is in,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.059
it's important to understand the information surrounding your market,

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.210
your competition, and the journey your customers take.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.370
Marketing analytics benefits your entire organization and it's one of

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:41.594
the most fundamental skills any marketer or business owner must hone.

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:45.754
Now, I'm sure you're aware there's a lot of data available to us.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:49.760
So it's important that we really measure what matters.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:52.265
We have to go beyond getting those metrics,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.535
we must sort out how to take action with that data.

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:59.089
We're going to spend a lot of time together talking about analytics,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.765
so let's talk about our goals for what we're studying.

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:06.890
We want to learn how this data is collected and distributed.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.500
Knowing where data comes from and how it's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.564
combined will help you understand how that data can be leveraged.

00:01:13.564 --> 00:01:15.769
You'll need to know where to look for this data,

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:20.614
and then you'll be more sensitive around the concerns of how data is collected.

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:24.349
We also want to understand the questions that we're trying to answer.

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:29.449
Every business is trying to get the right message to the right users at the right time.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.085
Your message and your timing and your users are well different than mine.

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:36.140
So you'll have to be specific with

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.519
the questions that you want to answer for your business goals.

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:43.560
We also want to understand the available metrics and how they're measured.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.500
In each channel, paid earned, and owned,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.105
you'll have different metrics,

00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:51.020
and you need to know which are the most important.

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:53.974
You also want to understand how they're used so that way,

00:01:53.974 --> 00:01:57.709
you can figure out how to combine them to get better insights.

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.769
We also want to figure out how to watch out for data reporting

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:04.644
pitfalls so we don't fall victim to common mistakes.

00:02:04.644 --> 00:02:09.574
Next, we need to figure out what metrics are important for your business goals.

00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:11.629
You have all of this data coming in,

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.939
but what data is actually important and actionable for your business.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.829
You need to be able to understand what data you're

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.310
going to use to get you from point a to point b.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.765
From here, we want to understand how to apply these metrics to your business.

00:02:26.764 --> 00:02:30.679
Everything that we do in marketing analytics is about being actionable.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.200
We want to understand the information and create

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.414
reports that can be used to drive real decisions.

00:02:36.414 --> 00:02:40.099
It's also important that we have confidence in reporting so that we can

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.229
take action on our analytics measurements and on the reporting we make.

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.119
All kinds of decisions get made on this data and you're going to want

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.990
the confidence that you've found the right information,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.510
use it in the right way,

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:53.949
and made the right decisions.

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:57.514
As you come to learn the foundations of marketing analytics,

00:02:57.514 --> 00:03:00.244
you'll be better equipped to gather, analyze,

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:04.259
and report on the data you need to make better decisions.
