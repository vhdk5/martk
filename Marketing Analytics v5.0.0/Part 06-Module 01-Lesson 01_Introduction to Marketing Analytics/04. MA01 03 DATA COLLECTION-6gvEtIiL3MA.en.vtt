00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.394
Now, the ecosystem of data is no doubt impressive.

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:08.209
So finding and using this information will become easier,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.655
if you understand how the data collection process works.

00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:14.324
Now, I'm sure it's no surprise to you that

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:17.984
every action you take on the web is tracked one way or another.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.184
The pages you view,

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:20.519
the files you download,

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.464
and even your demographic and interest data, is all recorded.

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:28.469
At the 2018, Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:31.364
Intel projected that by 2020,

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:34.229
we will be generating 1.5 gigabytes of data

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:37.754
per day from our individual Internet activities.

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:41.070
All of that tracking data we bought and sold by over

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.240
4,000 data brokers in the United States alone.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.704
Now, this data is collected as first,

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:50.664
second, and third party data.

00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:54.085
First party data is what you collect,

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:57.350
all the information that you immediately have access to,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.225
information coming from your website,

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.219
your subscriptions, and your CRM.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.859
Now, second party data is essentially all of the first party data that is resold.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.510
So if you collected data on your customers and sold that to someone else,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.920
it would then become second party data.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.879
This could include things such as your website data,

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:18.319
but it also goes as far as how people are

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:21.709
using an application or even surveys that you run.

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:23.994
Finally, third party data.

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:25.780
These are all the aggregators.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.924
Third-party data vendors by from all sorts of sources and then they combine this data.

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:35.619
Now, this data is coming from a myriad of places.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.930
First, we have the cookies that follow you

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.710
around or pixels that fire when you make a transaction,

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.619
and then we also have device fingerprinting,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.255
which is a really interesting method of combining information about you,

00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:51.780
such as your location, screen size,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.984
the hardware using, plugins you have,

00:01:53.984 --> 00:01:56.284
apps you have, software, and so on.

00:01:56.284 --> 00:01:58.899
Because it's easy to guess whether or not you're

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.960
the same person between two sessions on a site,

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.134
even if you leave your phone to your computer,

00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:07.040
because it's very unlikely that somebody else has

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.925
that exact combination of items on their device.

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:16.070
In fact, your very own Internet service provider could be selling data about who you are,

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.959
where you've been, and so on.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.599
So what can we do with this knowledge?

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.780
Well, we know that we can layer in all of

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.140
these additional insights into this traditionally flat information.

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.399
If you find a gap in your data and you want to fill it in to answer a question,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.939
you now understand that this information is out there and you can find

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.819
it and fill that it take Google Analytics, for example.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.180
Let's say I measure one visit to my website.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.580
Now, that data point is interesting,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.085
but there is a breadth of information behind it.

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:49.990
Google can tell me characteristics such as where that clip came from,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.985
how long that visit lasted,

00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:53.750
and the page that they were on.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.179
Now, that's all first party information,

00:02:56.179 --> 00:03:00.979
but dig deeper and you'll find that Google can bring me third party information,

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:02.590
such as the visitor's interests,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.955
their market segment, even their age range and gender.

00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:11.600
That data combined helps paint a much better picture of what's going on on my website.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.489
It tells me more about the type of people that are being exposed to my content,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.180
and it can help me understand how to change my marketing behaviors.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.519
So as we layer that data together,

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.620
we can answer more complex questions and segment in ways that provide us richer insight.
