00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Realistically we can make data tell any story that we

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.895
want and you can twist the metrics to make anything sound like a win.

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:12.930
This is why it's really important that what you measure and report on is

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.355
meaningful and that you're working on a shared vision for what you're trying to achieve.

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:19.170
By staying on a shared vision,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.810
you'll avoid the mistake of crafting

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.650
a narrative that isn't true to what you're actually working towards.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.300
Now as you're coming to see,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.600
we continue to keep layering concepts together.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.200
We talked about creating smart objectives but it's time to start

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.890
putting all of these layers together using a measurement framework.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.125
A measurement framework builds from the metrics up to your objectives.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.960
This is helpful, as you begin to work together

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.870
with other teams or even within your own team,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.795
you can coordinate across all of the channels,

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:53.245
platforms, and initiatives that are underway.

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:57.215
Additionally, if you go to work for a large company in a marketing department,

00:00:57.215 --> 00:01:00.470
you'll likely be introduced to an existing framework.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.040
Companies use all sorts of frameworks to stay unified.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.135
Some companies are going to use smart objectives,

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:08.855
others might use OKRs,

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:11.270
which stand for Objective Key Results,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.040
and others might use a laddering framework that combines objectives with KPIs,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.240
which stands for Key Performance Indicators.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.430
Now, what's important is that you're aware that there is

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.980
no one single framework but you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.375
really should be familiar that they exist and how to use them.

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:31.820
Now, realistically, frameworks are just a helpful way

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.120
of visualizing and making sense of data.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.480
As you sit down and start out in the marketing analytics process,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.030
you'll likely want to draft frameworks that help you.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.250
But as you go about your day and day,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.750
you're not really going to be drawing

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.540
a frame work for every problem you're going to solve.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.530
Now with that said, let's look at a very simple framework that helps you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.955
start to connect the final dots between how all of this works together.

00:01:55.955 --> 00:01:59.690
Now, sometimes, we'll have a big picture framework,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.630
starting at the top of the objectives,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.580
followed by KPIs, and then metrics.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.145
So the top, we might substitute our smart goal for a fairly big picture objective.

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:15.140
Let's say we've set a broad goal to simply create social media awareness.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.230
Below this, we use our KPIs to summarize

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.575
how well we are doing relative to those objectives.

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:25.250
Ultimately, this is the measurable and specific piece

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.790
of a smart goal but broken out for added clarity.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.655
So we want to create awareness on social media.

00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:35.165
Then we might need to set our KPIs to measure against something,

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:37.775
and that could be reached in traffic.

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:39.725
Then we need to tie metrics to these.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:42.860
These are the data points that inform our KPIs.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.030
So we'll need to measure impressions,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.970
engagements, and say unique visits.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.590
Now, ultimately, this is really just a way to help

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.400
plan for what data you're collecting and what you're measuring against.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.220
I simply want you to always be thinking about

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.310
the layered approach and how this all stacks together.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.440
Whether you have one objective or a dozen,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.030
or you use smart goals or broad goals combined with KPIs,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.520
all the elements are the same and there's always a framework behind them.
