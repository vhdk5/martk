00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
In the world of business and in marketing,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.439
we often talk a lot about processes.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.464
We do this because processes help us work efficiently and effectively.

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:12.759
They're also a great foundation when you're

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.599
starting out because it gives you something to work through.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.714
It helps you practice and repeat these behaviors

00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:22.719
that then allow you to understand why you're doing certain things.

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:25.164
Whatever we're trying to do with our data,

00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:27.699
the process is always the same.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.599
Measure, analyze, and improve.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.015
The first step is to measure.

00:00:34.015 --> 00:00:37.280
Now, we know that we have all of this data to pick from.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.475
Now, it's actually relatively cheap and easy to simply collect all of the data you can.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.515
However, that can cause some problems.

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:49.054
First of all, simply collecting all of the data you can could

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:52.820
create a problem by which you're just chasing after all of these sources.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.820
Remember, you simply want to be using the tools that matter

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.600
and then let those tools collect all the data that they can.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.820
When it comes time to use that data though,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.695
it's important to be selective.

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:07.325
Otherwise, it'll be like drinking from a fire hose.

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:09.769
When it comes to measure,

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:11.780
we're going to focus on these objectives.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.685
Remember, we take our objectives.

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:16.640
We look through that lens to determine what we're measuring.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.599
Now, once we've measured all of this data and we've collected these metrics,

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.219
it's time to analyze it.

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.855
So we take the data, we inspect it,

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:28.835
and we start developing insights that allow us to take action.

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:32.109
Analyzing data is similar to being a detective.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.870
Now, we're going to talk a lot about analyzing data later on and we'll

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.355
really go into depth about how to think through your analysis.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:44.450
After we've done the analyzing, we improve.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.079
Everything that we do has to be actionable,

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.105
you're going to hear me repeat this often.

00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:53.240
You need to figure out what you're really doing with this data.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.759
Simply collecting it and looking at it isn't good

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.579
enough and then reporting on it still isn't good enough.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.019
You need to make sure that the information that you're sharing has action behind it.

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:05.584
What is the goal of looking at this information?

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:08.799
What decision are you going to make based off of it?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.930
From there, you simply repeat this process.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.939
Every time you take on a new initiative,

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.189
whenever you start a new marketing campaign,

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.710
think first about what needs to be measured,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.754
then analyze it, and then improve it.

00:02:21.754 --> 00:02:26.000
As we spend more time together digging into real-world scenarios,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.414
always pay attention to the steps we take.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:30.185
Regardless of the project,

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:34.259
we're always going to measure, analyze, and improve
