00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
In this lesson, we've learned how massive the analytics ecosystem is,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.085
and how that ecosystem collects and distributes data.

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:11.925
We learned how to layer data together to answer our marketing questions,

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:15.900
and we studied the foundations of how the analytics process works,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.520
how to analyze our metrics,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.760
and the questions we need to answer on every project.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.430
We reviewed the most common types of metrics that are

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.340
available to us and how those metrics are measured.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.400
We also studied business goals and how important

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.535
they are for guiding us on our analytics projects.

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:35.744
We reviewed how and why we think actionably,

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.700
how our day-to-day using marketing analytics will look

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.435
and the values we should follow as we pursue new initiatives.

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:46.760
The analytics we use to measure our marketing is undoubtably complex,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.270
but you've gained a valuable foundation that we will continue to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.930
build on to further your skills and confidence in analytics.
