00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
I want to leave you with something that I hope you'll find

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.894
valuable as you start out in your marketing analytics endeavors.

00:00:06.894 --> 00:00:12.489
Jerry Rackley is a marketing author and executive and he created 10 values that I find

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.664
incredibly useful in guiding

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:18.684
any new initiative or on your journey as a marketing analyst.

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:20.695
Let me paraphrase them for you.

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:25.990
Every marketing initiative will begin with your success metrics. What is the objective?

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.399
What are you measuring,

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.744
and how do we qualify if we've been successful?

00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:36.685
Don't use or report metrics that are based on inaccurate or incomplete data.

00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:39.520
Don't use vanity metrics just to look

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.335
busy or because someone likes to see marketing numbers.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.829
Now everyone will have an opinion,

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.375
but metrics are the judge of the results or the success.

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:53.929
When the analytics output conflicts with your beliefs,

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.125
always choose the analytics.

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.185
When the analytics reveal good results, take credit.

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:03.385
When the analytics reveal poor results, take responsibility.

00:01:03.384 --> 00:01:07.450
Now don't use the output of the analytics process punitively.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.534
Only use it to improve.

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:12.234
Analytics don't make the decisions.

00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:15.900
They inform the decisions that we ultimately make.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.710
Now, every marketing initiative will end by reviewing the data.

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:26.239
I encourage you to follow these principles as you work on your own initiatives.
