00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
As we continue to lay the groundwork for our marketing analytics,

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:07.349
I want to revisit the topic of setting our business objectives.

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:10.844
I think it's important that we go a little deeper into what makes up our goals.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:13.589
Now, you might also hear these interchangeably

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.589
referred to as business goals or marketing goals,

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.589
and these are terms that all mean the same thing.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:25.050
Now your business objectives are the measurable targets of what you want to achieve,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.339
and all business objectives should follow the SMART goal format.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.159
SMART stands for Specific,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.404
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:39.950
As a grocery store, I might say that my objective is to sell

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.465
as much product as I can at the highest profit margin that I can.

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:46.940
But that's actually a very broad view.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:51.759
We need to really frame this objective in the context of SMART.

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:54.519
Instead, we'd be better off saying,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.670
generate $50,000 in revenue for the month of March.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.865
It's specific because we're sticking to just revenue,

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:03.800
we're not layering in other pieces.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.120
It's measurable because there is a metric there, $50,000.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.745
Now it's achievable, and this is all based on

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:13.325
how realistic this will be for your business.

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:18.325
Stretched goals are great but if the store is only doing $10,000 a month on average,

00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:23.390
asking for a $40,000 improvement in one month might not really be achievable.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.015
In this case, we'll assume that it is achievable.

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:29.239
Now it's relevant and it's time-bound because

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:32.644
we're measuring it in the context of one quarter.

00:01:32.644 --> 00:01:35.810
Now this is a pretty broad objective.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.454
So you might actually take this and break it down into

00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:43.194
individual initiatives that help you realize that goal.

00:01:43.194 --> 00:01:47.819
Now oftentimes, we break these objectives into key performance indicators,

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.759
and we'll talk more on that later.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.700
But ultimately, let's say for the grocery store that one of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.795
these smaller items is going to be boosting sales of soda,

00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:58.859
which is a high-margin product.

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.935
Or perhaps, in order to achieve that 50,000 revenue goal,

00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:05.659
we really need to increase the efficiency of our ads,

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.099
which will save us money,

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.324
but try to still bring in that same amount of revenue.

00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:12.514
As you look at your analytics project,

00:02:12.514 --> 00:02:15.989
be sure you're working off SMART goals.
