00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
As we think through your marketing channels,

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:07.995
you'll likely hear me referring to a channel that is either paid, earned, or owned.

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:11.550
Now, these are fairly common terms used in the day-to-day of marketing.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.655
So let's take a minute to make sure we're on the same page.

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:18.689
Your paid media will make up everything that you, well, pay for.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.015
This includes channels like newspaper ads,

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:24.015
radio spots, Facebook ads, and direct mailing.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:28.019
Your owned media is everything that includes your website,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.050
your list of customers that you use to send out your emails,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.109
or even a blog that has an active readership.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.174
Earned media is the world of organic press.

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:40.009
Word-of-mouth marketing, mentions on other blogs,

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:44.539
and news articles written about you all make up channels within earned media.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.519
Now, you might be asking yourself,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.945
"What about social media?"

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:51.710
Well, social media actually can live within all three.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.399
Social media could be a channel that you buy ads on paid,

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.640
it could be a channel by which you own the property and send messages out,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.005
or it could be an area by which you're earning mentions on

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:07.240
other people's social handles such as someone posting a tweet about you.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:09.924
Now, all of these channels will overlap,

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:12.274
just as they overlap with social media.

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:15.530
These make up the foundation of marketing.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.390
Let's talk about owned media.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.795
I think it's really easy to start here because this is really primarily your own website.

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:25.394
Here, you're tracking how many visitors,

00:01:25.394 --> 00:01:26.715
where they're coming from,

00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:28.320
what pages they're visiting,

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:29.449
how long they've stayed,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.880
and even what page they left from.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.280
When you look at your owned analytics,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.875
you get a sense of how users are finding your site,

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:38.734
if they found what they want,

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:43.099
if you're advertising objectives or driving a meaningful amount of traffic,

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:47.964
and even whether your product or service is meeting the goals of your customers.

00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:49.890
With a resource like Google Analytics,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.885
you install a tracking code and from there,

00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:57.685
you have that goldmine of data to leverage segment and correlate.

00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:01.040
For example, let's say you make a change to your website and you

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.400
notice on that day web traffic drops dramatically.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.880
Well, now you have a sense of where to start looking for that problem.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.924
If you rolled out a new landing page,

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:14.689
you might see an increase in conversions resulting from that specific page,

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.344
or perhaps you see a sudden spike in traffic.

00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:18.814
By drilling into that,

00:02:18.814 --> 00:02:24.109
you can identify the source such as a social media post or a mention on an online blog.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.430
Now, let's take a look at paid data.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.155
When you run online paid advertisements,

00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:33.655
you'll find that the platform you use is typically tied to several reports.

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:36.500
This data is extremely useful as it can give you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.349
granular details on which ads are working,

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.525
what targeting makes sense, and more.

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:45.805
If you're paying for ads in print or sponsorship within your local community,

00:02:45.805 --> 00:02:49.400
you might have to leverage unique ways to capture data.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.455
This could involve a landing page with a custom URL or even accustomed phone number.

00:02:54.455 --> 00:02:58.520
Oftentimes, you'll have to attach records from various sources in

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.855
order to understand what's happening with those particular campaigns.

00:03:02.854 --> 00:03:04.369
If you run a promotion,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.629
you might, for example,

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.905
keep track of the amount of coupons that come through the door.

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:13.414
Now, it's harder when you move into broadcast media to really measure the impact.

00:03:13.414 --> 00:03:18.019
For that, you often have to really start to correlate trends and changes.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.350
Oftentimes, it's better to work with the agency that's running

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.965
your TV or radio spots to really get into the nitty gritty of analyzing that data.

00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:30.229
Now, the final part comes from earned media.

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.109
This one is typically the most difficult.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.650
Here, your outcomes aren't necessarily determined by

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.680
spend but how interesting people think your product and services are.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.409
Here, you're tracking things like your social media fanbase,

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.509
how many mentions you have in articles or your share of voice.

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:52.699
You may have many dashboards that you collect this data in and you'll want to

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.185
look at it alongside all of your other advertising metrics.

00:03:57.185 --> 00:04:00.590
The best way to measure results with earned media is to have

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.504
your own goals and objectives that you are comparing that data to.

00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:07.490
So for example, you decide that a mention in

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.439
a magazine would increase your revenue potential by a $1,000.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.699
Well, now you can track how you're trending

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.370
towards that goal and the effort you're investing.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.800
Remember, we're always trying to layer this data towards that objective,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.689
so we remember what metrics we need to get us there.

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:27.680
Now, there's an endless amount of data providers out there as we saw,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.009
so investigate them against your needs and keep a system

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.459
in place that provides you with the necessary checks and balances.
