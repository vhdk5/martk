00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.605
Let's talk about analyzing metrics.

00:00:02.605 --> 00:00:08.218
Earlier, we touched on one component of our analytics process and that was analyzing,

00:00:08.218 --> 00:00:10.844
but we've only scratched the surface.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:12.929
When it comes to analyzing data,

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.719
it's actually a fairly deep concept and there's

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.589
a true methodology by which we want to look at these insights.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.530
Now the skill of drawing information out of

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.250
our datasets is often going to be the result of experience.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.320
As you spend more time with the data,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.449
you'll get more comfortable at finding

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.479
connections between all of these different data points.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:35.684
But simply being curious,

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:38.150
having an outside the box way of thinking,

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.799
and figuring out how to see the bigger picture is a great place to start.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:45.559
Analyzing the marketing metrics tells us what is

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.490
happening but only if we do our analysis properly.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.719
Now it's just as likely you'll do a bad analysis on good data

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.954
as it is you'll do a fantastic analysis on bad or suspect data.

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:02.554
It's actually rarely the case that the data itself is bad,

00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:05.885
but rather the way the data is interpreted.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:11.255
For example, it's easy to mix up a visit and a pageview.

00:01:11.254 --> 00:01:13.819
A visit is one person arriving whereas

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:17.449
a pageview is something that happens every time a page loads.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.600
A visitor can have many pageviews.

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:23.704
Think about a visitor to our grocery store.

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:27.280
They come in and they could look at many products,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.320
but that one person has looked at many things.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.619
If we instead accidentally modeled our conversion rate on

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.030
how many products were looked at versus how many people purchased,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.200
we'd have a really unrealistic view of what's happening.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.465
So the metrics that you use need to be accurate.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:48.530
You need to be using the right data and the right data points.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.140
Also, in our analysis process,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.359
all of these metrics must be compared.

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.159
So we start with them being accurate,

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.189
and then we think about how we compare them.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.159
Comparison is important because without it,

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.250
the metrics will really provide no sense of direction.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.620
So in order to generate a comparison,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.460
we look at change and context over time.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.939
In other words, how does this metric change during

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.389
a period of time and what is the context of that change?

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.754
Is it normal or abnormal?

00:02:19.754 --> 00:02:21.224
So I want to give you an example.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:24.289
Let's say that we open up our store and there are no visitors.

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.929
The first thing that we have to do is compare that.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.430
So if you look to yesterday,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.830
is zero less than yesterday or more than yesterday for that same window of time?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.660
If we opened up the story yesterday and we had

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.210
three visitors and today we have zero, well,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.939
now we know that the change is we have three less visitors during this same time period.

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.844
Now we have to ask is that normal or abnormal?

00:02:45.844 --> 00:02:47.689
To do that, we might have to zoom out.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.669
We might need to look at a trend over time.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.549
Do we typically have a lot of visitors in the morning?

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.800
Is today different from other days?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.255
Perhaps today is a Saturday and most people aren't coming in this early on a Saturday.

00:02:59.254 --> 00:03:01.579
So we have to look at the context,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.020
we have to zoom out to really understand whether that change is normal or abnormal.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.780
Analyzing the data is an exercise that's oftentimes like being a detective.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.405
So remember, when you analyze your metrics,

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:17.015
you always want to start with accurate metrics.

00:03:17.014 --> 00:03:19.069
From there, you need to compare them.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.859
You have to look at change and context.
