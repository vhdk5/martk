00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
Let's take a minute to review everything we've covered.

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.779
We started by talking about the ecosystem.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.870
We saw all of the tools and data sources that we can gather insights from.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.890
We also talked about how this data arrives from first party,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.005
second party to third party.

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.524
Then, we looked at how we layer this data.

00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:24.329
We talked a little bit out an example of a grocery store,

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.869
and how we start thinking about questions and framing our problems.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.170
Then, we looked at a process by which to really review

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.995
this data: measure, analyze, and improve.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:38.399
From there, we looked at how to dive deeper into

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.614
the analyzed piece of that analytics process by looking at metrics,

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:45.090
so they're accurate and compared,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.175
and thinking of compared as change versus context.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:54.724
Next, we talked about five questions to answer in every analytics project.

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:57.245
What happened? Were the results good?

00:00:57.244 --> 00:00:58.789
Why did it happen?

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.064
What's happening now, and what's ahead in the future?

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:09.739
From there, we looked at common questions and common metrics for a variety of situations.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:12.244
From there, we looked at business goals,

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:14.785
especially how to create smart ones.

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:18.229
Then, we looked at how to establish frameworks to take

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.189
those goals and make them actionable with metrics.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.280
Finally, we reviewed paid, earned,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.629
and owned, and all of the type of metrics that fit into those channels.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:31.504
So I know what you might be thinking.

00:01:31.504 --> 00:01:33.500
This is a lot of information.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.930
But soon enough, we're going to start applying

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.275
this information which will help to reinforce the concept we've learned.

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:41.030
As you move further through this course,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.099
you can always come back and revisit

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:47.579
these concepts to see how they apply to what we're going to be doing later.
