00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.635
Up until this point,

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:05.669
we've looked at analytics as a way to answer questions that we have.

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:09.870
We framed the question and then we use analytics to identify the answer.

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.464
But there's another way that we can look at marketing analytics,

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:15.029
and that's through the experiments that we run.

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.309
Let's take AB testing for example.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.679
This is something that we will do often as marketers.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.829
Perhaps I want to evaluate whether a call to action makes

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.294
more sense on the left side of the page or on the right side of the page.

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:27.540
I would set up a test,

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.890
I would measure the results,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.839
and I would identify the outcome.

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.609
From there, I can take action.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.019
If the button on the left side performed better,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.410
then I would know that it wins and we would

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.649
replace whatever we had on the page with that winning option.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.850
We would use our analytics to identify that outcome.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.550
You may also be working off a growth model such as high tempo testing.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.454
In this type of growth,

00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:52.534
you're coming up with a series of ideas,

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:53.794
putting them into test,

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.285
and identifying which ones win.

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:59.899
Again, you're setting an outcome that you hope to

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.379
happen and you're measuring on whether that outcome did happen,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.960
or what the outcome actually was.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:09.379
So we can either ask questions and look for answers,

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:14.784
or we can develop a hypothesis to start our research project.

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:21.334
Now, a hypothesis is a proposed explanation for how two variables are related.

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:25.009
For example, I could hypothesize that changing

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.540
that call to action improves conversions on my website.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.430
Now, when it comes to hypothesis,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.840
you should never phrase it as a question.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.159
It should be written as a statement that can be rejected or confirmed.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.409
We create and design tests.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.394
Now, we can figure out the metrics that are necessary

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:46.659
to identify whether a hypothesis comes true.
