00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.889
One of my first jobs out of high school was working for a grocery store.

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:07.080
It was a really interesting job.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.789
I got to meet a lot of people,

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.064
and I also got to observe all of the interesting ways that a grocery store works.

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:15.179
Now, picture grocery store with me.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.820
You walk in, and the store is stocked,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.429
you'll have everything from vegetables,

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.350
all the way to canned goods,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.570
and there are all of these different products.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.810
Followed behind that, you have people that come into the store,

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:29.969
and every person is going to have different behaviors.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:32.594
Some are coming in for one specific item,

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:35.460
others are coming in and they're browsing the store.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.280
Now, at the end of that browsing period,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.255
the customer is going to come check out,

00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:42.935
they're going to pay for whatever they've bought, and they're going to leave.

00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:47.600
Now, imagine trying to grow this grocery store without any data.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.005
We couldn't, we'd have no idea what to put on the shelf,

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:52.910
or how much we can pay our employees,

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.129
or whether we were making any money at all.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.190
So think about owning a grocery store.

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:00.754
What data would we want to collect?

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:03.620
Well, if we take a top-down approach,

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.034
let's think about our objectives.

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:08.569
Primarily, we need to sell groceries,

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.969
and we need to be profitable.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:13.834
So if we need to be profitable,

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:17.328
then we need to make sure that we're capturing data on sales,

00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:20.109
and we also need to have data on how much we're spending,

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:21.569
and how much we're making money.

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.250
If we need to sell groceries,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.734
then we need to keep track of what products we're moving.

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:29.420
Now, from a bottom-up approach,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.100
we could ask this a different way.

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.544
What if instead we wanted to answer the question,

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:36.665
what are the most popular hours at my grocery store?

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:40.775
Well, what data do you think we would need to answer this question?

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:45.380
Well, I would need to measure how many people come to the store each hour.

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:50.015
But here's the tricky part. How do we quantify what we mean by popular?

00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:54.155
Is the store popular because there are lots of people in it for that hour?

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:59.079
Or is the store popular because we make the most money in that hour?

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.629
Well, that's going to depend on your business objectives.

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:04.804
If you opened up a brand new grocery store,

00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:06.515
you might be focusing on awareness,

00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:08.344
you simply want foot traffic.

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:11.509
Therefore, you might want to measure how many people are

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.689
coming through the store more than you care about whether you're making money yet.

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.939
Now, a more mature grocery store might be

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.104
concerned about making money during a certain period of time,

00:02:20.104 --> 00:02:24.319
and therefore, popularity would be a measurement of revenue during that timeframe.

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.250
Now, the point of this thought experience is to get you to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.395
start thinking about all of the nuances in the marketing analytics process.

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:36.950
We need to know what questions we want to answer,

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:41.284
and then we need to know how we will qualify that that's the answer we want.

00:02:41.284 --> 00:02:45.919
From there, we can figure out the right data to combine.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:48.969
When it comes to answering questions,

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.275
we're always combining data.

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:55.775
Let's think about a few more questions we can ask in regards to our grocery store.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:58.280
Some will be easy to qualify.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.055
What isn't selling?

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:04.129
So we can simply measure what products sold and which products didn't,

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.019
there isn't a lot of data to combine there.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.155
What about how many repeat customers do we get?

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:11.550
So that's a measurement of loyalty,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.790
although we're simply asking how many times a customer comes during a period of time.

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.729
How about where is most of our profit coming from?

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.844
Probably easy to qualify as well,

00:03:21.844 --> 00:03:23.659
maybe do we ever run out of stock,

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.504
if so, on what or how much money would we lose on a particular day?

00:03:28.504 --> 00:03:31.879
But some questions are harder to qualify.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.444
Take this one. Are customers loyal?

00:03:34.444 --> 00:03:37.030
Well, what does loyalty mean?

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.770
Is loyalty a measurement of how much money someone spends?

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.320
Is loyalty a measurement of how many times they visit?

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.319
Is loyalty a measure of how many times they visit in a period of time?

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.969
Is it three times a week or three times a year?

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:51.504
That's for you to decide.

00:03:51.504 --> 00:03:53.805
Another really tough question to qualify,

00:03:53.805 --> 00:03:56.415
is the store laid out in a good manner?

00:03:56.414 --> 00:03:58.004
Well, that's another tough one,

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.469
because we have to combine all sorts of data.

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.050
Is the store laid out in a good manner depends on our goals.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.225
Are we trying to sell a particular product?

00:04:05.224 --> 00:04:07.564
Perhaps we're pushing a new product,

00:04:07.564 --> 00:04:10.319
therefore we might decide that it needs to be on an end cap,

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.289
and we decide that if it sells more than if it was in a row,

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:18.050
then yes, the store was laid out better than if it was put somewhere else.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.305
There are all sorts of metrics that have to be layered into that.

00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:24.110
Ultimately, what we're trying to accomplish is

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.425
becoming aware of how we have to frame our mindset.

00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:29.810
Every time we think of questions to answer,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.579
we must also be aware of how we're qualifying whether we've arrived at the right answer.
