00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
The marketing analytics that we do and report on,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.060
provides direction for the entire company.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.589
So you'll want to be confident when it comes time to put this into practice.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.820
Now, confidence is going to come from experience and practice,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.375
but also in knowing that you're approaching things the right way.

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:23.009
So let's talk about ways that marketing analytics projects come about,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.510
how you'll likely get involved early on in your career or with a new business,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.460
and how we can approach it.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.100
Because when you step into a role in marketing,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.700
you'll be putting your analytic skills into practice immediately.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.060
So the first thing that we can do if you're new to a team,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.690
is ask lots of questions.

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:46.659
Questions don't have to come across as you being unskilled or under experienced,

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.564
but instead they actually demonstrate confidence.

00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:53.429
You're making sure that you're approaching things properly and gaining clarity,

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.969
and you'll gain a lot of respect for doing so.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.504
When you jump into a team or a new project,

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:00.490
don't assume the vision is clear,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.440
don't assume the data is accurate,

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:05.269
and don't assume that you have the full picture.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.729
When you're new to something,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.290
that is your opportunity to gain clarity,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.680
and you'll do that by asking questions.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.935
Now, you're slowly becoming more and more armed with taking on

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.260
individual analytics projects and honing

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.515
your skills on research and how to use that data.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:25.525
But there are a few points here to help you be more successful at that.

00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:29.070
For starters, you need to recognize your bias.

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.339
When we work on something,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.674
we often want a particular outcome.

00:01:32.674 --> 00:01:35.899
We've worked really hard and we've invested a lot of our time,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.140
and so it's very easy to have a bias and start to twist

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.890
the data to tell a version of the story or events that we want.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.219
You got to stop. It's really important to tell the real story.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.530
Again, big decisions are going to be made on

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.144
this data and it'll fall apart if the data is inaccurate.

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:56.854
Another piece as you're starting out is to not be surprised by metrics.

00:01:56.855 --> 00:02:00.978
If you act surprised that you're expected to pull a report or run an analysis,

00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:02.359
you'll look out of place.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.450
Think ahead and begin to be prepared for

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.400
the fact that you will be asked to participate in an analytics project.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.395
Again, you can always ask for clarity.

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:15.530
Now another really great thing to do when you're new to a team or

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.400
a project is to practice socializing your findings.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.210
As you're looking at data and gaining deeper insights about what's going on,

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.680
start talking to other people on your team about it.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.490
You'll find that they'll add in additional insights that help you build

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.385
that layer of history that you need to be better at connecting those dots.

00:02:33.384 --> 00:02:38.224
Now, you'll find that projects and analytics range from small to large.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.759
So you'll want to get in the habit of having

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:45.324
good practices so that you're more efficient as they come about.

00:02:45.324 --> 00:02:50.944
Let's switch gears, I want to talk about how this starts to show up in your day-to-day.

00:02:50.944 --> 00:02:55.159
For starters, analytics is not an extracurricular activity.

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.424
It shouldn't be something you do when you have time.

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:00.725
It needs to be baked into your routine.

00:03:00.724 --> 00:03:02.569
As you start your day,

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.555
you're going to want to be looking at your most important metrics.

00:03:05.555 --> 00:03:07.775
You're going to be expected to know these.

00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:10.129
When I'm working with my marketing team,

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.224
I often ask them randomly how their campaign is performing,

00:03:14.224 --> 00:03:15.724
how sales are doing,

00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:17.704
how a particular email did,

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:20.240
and they're expected to know that answer.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.920
You don't want to be caught off guard.

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.799
It's really easy to get locked in the idea that you're going to be

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.993
reporting on these findings in a formal manner,

00:03:27.993 --> 00:03:29.360
at a particular meeting,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.265
or maybe after a campaign ends.

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:33.589
But really, you need to be in that data often

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.425
as informal conversations come up all the time.

00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:41.090
Now later, I'll guide you through what data that you'll want to be tracking at a minimum,

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.164
but for now focus on owning that data.

00:03:44.164 --> 00:03:46.549
If there's a problem collecting the data,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.620
make it known that you've lost visibility.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.325
Take time to go into deeper insights or delegate them.

00:03:52.324 --> 00:03:55.119
You don't want to wait to let problems creep in,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.890
and that's why we set a cadence for review.

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.429
Think about those daily metrics and then what metrics you might need to be

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.905
looking at on a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly basis.

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:09.349
It's also important that you're anticipating the questions

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.500
that might be asked and starting to prepare those reports early.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.800
You can even build out templates so that you're dropping in the data as you have it.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.100
Now, how you're involved in analytics is going to vary from job to job.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.689
You will be involved,

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:26.459
so start planning ahead.
