00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.765
With every analytics project or analytics endeavor,

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:05.939
we must report on our data.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.005
Now, we've touched on the importance of always having an action for our metrics.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.850
But let's talk deeper on how we

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.285
distribute and share the actions that we want to take place.

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:16.769
Within your marketing career,

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.679
you're going to be tasked with building reports.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.394
Reports are how you share your findings,

00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:24.539
and socialize the recommendations.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.594
Essentially, you'll use reports to inform others of what action you hope to see happen.

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:33.799
You're going to be framing the problem,

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:39.334
and then proposing a solution or indicating that somebody needs to find that solution.

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:41.870
So when it comes to building great reports,

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:44.479
it's important that you keep things simple.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.294
Most of your analytics data would be presented as slides,

00:00:48.295 --> 00:00:54.800
and you should start by gathering the following information: your overview.

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:58.265
What's the goal or the objectives that you're measuring against?

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.950
This is essentially why you started this project.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.304
So you want to frame what's going on.

00:01:03.304 --> 00:01:05.924
Next is your hypothesis.

00:01:05.924 --> 00:01:07.694
What did you expect to happen?

00:01:07.694 --> 00:01:09.569
What was the desired outcome?

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.854
Was your hypothesis true or false?

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:16.275
From there, it's important to explain the methodology.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:18.165
How much data was collected,

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:20.010
and where was that data collected?

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.785
You're trying to help everyone understand that your findings are accurate.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.729
From here, well, the actual data.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.040
These are the metrics that you measured,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.734
and the graphs and charts that go with them.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:35.390
Finally, your recommendations.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.585
What should happen now that someone has seen this data?

00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:42.854
Typically, you keep this to three to five tactics.

00:01:42.855 --> 00:01:45.350
Things that are immediately executable.

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.750
They can include your social media tactics,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.254
or any other communications based on those findings.

00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:55.074
Finally, at the end of your presentation,

00:01:55.075 --> 00:01:56.704
you can include everything else.

00:01:56.704 --> 00:01:58.459
This is your backup research,

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:59.944
any findings you've had,

00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:02.329
or all of the additional information that you

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.149
believe adds additional context to the conversation.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.530
It's there just in case the conversation warrants it.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.280
Now, as you sit down to create your report,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.814
you want to think about who's reading it.

00:02:13.814 --> 00:02:16.319
While we talked about the foundations,

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.439
you'll ultimately customize this to

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.564
the audience that you're presenting this information to.

00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:25.564
You may need to add more information, or remove it.

00:02:25.564 --> 00:02:28.370
Simply use that foundation as a starting point.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.590
But let's talk about how we can adapt

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.849
these reports depending on who typically receives them.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.009
Now when it comes to sharing your data,

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.924
it's usually either going to go to somebody who's in an executive position,

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:42.330
or somebody who's in a management position,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.620
or perhaps to an analyst for further review.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.610
Executives like everything short.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.680
They're hoping to see a very small amount of data.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.230
They don't have time for the whole picture.

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.634
Management is really looking at how they take action.

00:02:57.634 --> 00:02:59.614
They'd like to see a bigger picture,

00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:03.115
so they can understand whether or not the actions make sense.

00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:06.000
The analyst, well, they want all of the data.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.449
They're hoping to help understand and reframe

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:12.094
the problem in a way that arrives at action.

00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:14.780
Let's talk a little bit more about the executives.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.634
Here's some information that you can include.

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:20.204
First, your project scope.

00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:22.505
You want to remind them what you are working on.

00:03:22.504 --> 00:03:24.544
Not every executive is going to know about

00:03:24.544 --> 00:03:27.019
every objective that's going on in the company.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.355
So you want to frame the problem around that project scope.

00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:32.759
Who started it, who was working on it,

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.169
and what was the outcome,

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.969
or where were you headed?

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:40.879
Now, this is really going to be your overview and hypotheses slides mixed together,

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.594
including those details on that team leadership.

00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:46.650
Next, talk about the key data points.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.480
Again, keep it simple.

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.549
Most executives don't care about all of the data that you have.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.205
Now, when it comes to your methodology,

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:56.855
this is typically less important.

00:03:56.854 --> 00:03:59.959
You're really focusing on showing those findings.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.760
We saw this happen,

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.674
and it happened because of these events.

00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:07.835
Now, it's important that you still include those key recommendations.

00:04:07.835 --> 00:04:09.695
Again, everything is actionable.

00:04:09.694 --> 00:04:13.174
So have ideas on what can be done with this information.

00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:15.890
Also, you can frame this in the context of,

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.919
why are you sharing this information?

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.410
Why are you presenting it?

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.030
What takeaways are going to be important there?

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.674
Now when it comes to preparing a presentation for a management,

00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:28.535
things are roughly the same,

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:30.770
but there's a few changes.

00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:34.310
We also want to talk about the project's scope.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.649
These would be the tools that you use to collect the data,

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:40.609
the date ranges that are used to find these results,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.694
and the volume of data that you collected.

00:04:42.694 --> 00:04:46.099
This is because someone in management is likely going to want to make

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.615
sure that they agree with how you arrived at this conclusion.

00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:51.990
Now, you'll still include your key data points,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.250
because everyone's going to be interested in,

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.454
what are the summary of those findings?

00:04:56.454 --> 00:04:59.169
Again, what did you measure, and why?

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.790
Finally, it's okay to include note-worthy data.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.280
You might exclude elements from the executive report to prevent it from being too long.

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.625
But with management, you'll want to include that information.

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:14.959
As always, you're going to include those recommendations.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:16.729
You may have thoughts and ideas,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.535
even if you're not sure how to solve the problem.

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:21.689
Now when it comes to analysts,

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.949
they're going to care about everything the managers care about,

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.495
plus all of your raw data.

00:05:26.495 --> 00:05:28.985
This is the time to overshare.

00:05:28.985 --> 00:05:32.824
That raw data might lead to additional research projects,

00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:35.509
or ways that that data can be refined.

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:39.875
They're going to be incredibly curious about how you arrived at these findings,

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:42.204
and they'll want to walk through in detail,

00:05:42.204 --> 00:05:45.305
the methodology on how you got there.

00:05:45.305 --> 00:05:50.915
Now remember, part of action is also communicating what needs to happen.

00:05:50.915 --> 00:05:54.890
These reports give you a valuable way to frame your thoughts,

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.115
but do so in a way that keeps it simple,

00:05:57.115 --> 00:06:00.920
while still demonstrating that you've evaluated it in depth.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.680
You want to make sure that you never assume that everyone

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.420
knows all the metrics and what you've collected,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.905
but you also don't want to burden them with all of the details.

00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:11.949
Create plenty of opportunities,

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.300
so that the people that you're presenting to can ask

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.030
questions or probe for more, if they're skeptical.
