  <h3></h3>
  <div>
  <p>Marketing Managers and Marketing Analysts get asked a variety of questions, some more specific than others. Here’s some of the most common questions you’ll be expected to answer when you’re part of a marketing initiative. </p>
<p><strong>Who is buying your products?</strong></p>
<p>What kind of a person is your typical consumer? There are different ways we can qualify this person and quantify how many there are of each type: ie, how many customers are within a certain age range or of a particular gender? How much money do they have? You can choose to, for example, only target customers who are above a certain financial bracket, but it is important to make this a conscious decision. </p>
<p><strong>Who is not buying your products?</strong></p>
<p>This is one that may not be so obvious but when you think about it, it makes sense! Perhaps some in this group may never buy your product, but it’s those consumers in that grey area who could buy your product who might just boost your sales. </p>
<p><strong>What is the behavior like of your typical consumer?</strong></p>
<p>For example, if you have an online shopping business, it may be useful to know what percentage of customers research the products, or look at customer reviews, or compare prices with your competitors. Understanding the way the buyer behaves can help you understand why they choose to buy a product or not. </p>
<p><strong>What are customers not getting enough of from your product?</strong></p>
<p>Collect information about what improvements should be made to your products, or what types of products to order more of, to better serve consumer demand. You can do so by pulling trends from online reviews, conducted surveys, online forums etc., but the main point is to find out what would increase customer satisfaction, which will ultimately increase sales. Trending complaints analysis is a good place to start!</p>
<p><strong>What is the demand for your product?</strong></p>
<p>You should be able to determine an estimate of how many of each of your products you will be able to sell in a given time period. These analytics can be based off of old data on how many products have been sold, as well as current data from other companies with similar products. A time series analysis can offer extra insight here.</p>
<p><strong>Who else is selling your products?</strong></p>
<p>Get to know your competitors. What are their prices for similar products? What are their strengths and weaknesses considering both the product itself, and their marketing techniques? What do consumers say about your competitors and how they compare to you?</p>
<p><strong>How much money can your products go for?</strong></p>
<p>To maximize on your revenue, it’s a no-brainer that you should determine how much money your customers are willing to spend on your products. Using data analytics is a much smarter way come up with price points for particular items or services. </p>
<p><strong>Where should you sell your products?</strong></p>
<p>This can be quite a literal question, as in a store or any business housed in a physical place. Or we can use a looser interpretation, for online businesses, and consider which digital mediums are used. In the latter case, it may be easier to “move” the business if data analysis indicates other avenues are more viable. </p>
<p><strong>How should you market your products/business?</strong></p>
<p>This question gets at the actual “marketing” strategies, like advertising and ways of getting your business known. Who should be your target audience and through which mediums can you best reach them? How can you adapt your campaign to influence your consumer most effectively?</p>
<p><strong>What are current trends in my business sector?</strong></p>
<p>This question is important as it looks at external factors to your specific business. Looking at the broader industry-wide trends can better help you understand and predict consumer behavior. You can also more accurately measure your performance in comparison to your competitors.</p>
<p><strong>What current economic factors affect your business?</strong></p>
<p>Here is another question targeting external trends and conditions. For example, if there has been a recent market crash, people may be less likely to buy what they would consider luxury items. We can quantify how many consumers would be, how many consider your products to be luxury items, if your target consumer is less affected by the market crash… etc. </p>
<p><strong>Who should you employ to be a part of your business?</strong></p>
<p>Many factors go into this question, such as determining the skill-set of your workers, how rare or valuable they are, where else these kinds of people are hired, how much you need to pay them… etc. How would a different kind of employee affect the success of your business?</p>
<p><strong>What other businesses will you work with?</strong></p>
<p>Who will be your manufactures or suppliers? How much will their quality affect your sales? For example, if your target consumer is a “millennial” or somehow a conscientious shopper, you may not want to supply from companies that source from child sweatshops. You can research trends in the supplier’s track record.</p>
<p><strong>What are people saying about your business/products on social media?</strong></p>
<p>These days social media is a key influencer on your business. People express their likes/dislikes, and it is a main avenue for advertising. Collect information on consumers’ perceptions of your products, their needs, and how your marketing strategy can shift their general attitude. Sentiment analysis is a great tool for this. </p>
<p><strong>What are some future trends that you can predict about your sales?</strong></p>
<p>The best analysts need to think ahead! Information gained from the above questions can inform the predictive data generated for this question. For example, data on consumer behavior can be used to predict how likely customers are to buy a certain product or how much they are willing to spend. </p>
<p><strong>Make an infographic or chart</strong> </p>
<p>Marketing analysts might be asked to make infographics to present their data findings and analysis in a clear way which organizes the trends and information gathered. When presenting trends to management visualization of the data is most effective.</p>
