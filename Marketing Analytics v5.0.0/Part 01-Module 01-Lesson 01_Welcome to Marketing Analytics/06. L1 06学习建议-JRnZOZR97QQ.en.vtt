00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.649
Hi. I'm Juno.

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:02.520
I'm Josh.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.720
We're here to share some tips on how to help you succeed in this nano degree program.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:11.384
So, Josh, you've seen a lot of students go do this program. What's your advice?

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:16.439
Yes. So, I think one of the biggest things is to be successful in the program.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.870
You have to be a really active learner.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.890
What that means is not just watching all of the videos,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.000
but also a lot of our most successful students take notes,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.129
and they take really good notes.

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:31.649
So, whether that's screenshots of the videos and then written

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.789
notes underneath on type out notes or for me,

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.890
I actually like just writing things in

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.515
a notepad that I carry around with me and then I can look at later.

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:44.615
Also, just when there's coding,

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:46.170
writing the code yourself.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.920
So, I think one of the biggest things is you have to write code to learn how to code,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.710
and sometimes that's just a lot of repetition.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.975
Beyond that, there's a lot of things to do with

00:00:56.975 --> 00:01:00.550
time management and how do you manage your time to be a successful student?

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.599
Sure. Managing time is definitely

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.045
a very tricky component that has a big contribution to success.

00:01:07.045 --> 00:01:08.219
But what we've seen,

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.409
is that students who are most successful,

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.054
come to a classroom at least two times a week.

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:16.870
So, just making sure you make that habit of going to the classroom regularly,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.200
you can make a huge difference.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.515
There's lots of ways to do that.

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:21.329
Yeah. Whether that's due like mobile apps or

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.519
just like blocking out times in your calendar,

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:26.855
and just keeping that on your daily routine.

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:30.430
But everything is dependent on your background,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.090
what your learning style is,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.125
and which parts of the course might be newer to you or easier for you.

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:37.379
So, in the end,

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:40.009
just getting to know what your pace is and setting expectations for

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.219
yourself and being open to adjusting your time estimations,

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.355
can really help you succeed in the program.

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:49.370
So, sometimes, maybe a particular quiz in a lesson

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.070
might take you a lot longer than other parts of the lesson.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.250
Sometimes, this can be really good because it can help reinforce

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.140
your understanding and really develop your knowledge in that specific topic.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.734
But sometimes, it could take way longer than you want to and it can be frustrating.

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:05.590
Do you have any advice on how to deal with these situations?

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.640
Yeah. So, I'll call those blockers,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.305
and I think we all get them.

00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:13.115
I think there's two big ways to address blockers.

00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:14.765
One is to use the community.

00:02:14.764 --> 00:02:19.019
There are students who just went through the content that you're going through,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.320
who just had to learn this for the first time too.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.734
A lot of times, they can give really good advice for things outside of the classroom or

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:28.520
specific videos within the classroom or

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.650
specific texts components within the classroom

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.420
that helped them really internalize an idea.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.984
Then, the second thing is just being able to Google well.

00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:39.770
Googling is a skill in of itself.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.895
I think that whether it's being able to take like

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:48.395
an error from your code and search it or read through the documentation,

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:52.865
or whether you're trying to really grasp a large project,

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:57.140
and you're looking through it entire blog posts or Quora post,

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.319
all of those things can help you better internalize the content

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.699
and even solved just small snips that might be happening in your code.

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.949
So, with that, do you have

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.250
any final thoughts for students before they tackle their Nanodegree program?

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.919
Yeah. So, we hope these tips can help you.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.424
But in the end, learning is really a mindset,

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:17.060
and everyone's going to struggle.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.775
You have to go into this knowing that it's going to be challenging,

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:21.830
and just making sure a patient with yourself

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.770
and determined to make sure this is the best learning experience for you,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.235
can really help you succeed.

00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:28.515
Yeah. So, thank you.

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:32.479
We hope that our tips can help you be successful with your Nanodegree program.
