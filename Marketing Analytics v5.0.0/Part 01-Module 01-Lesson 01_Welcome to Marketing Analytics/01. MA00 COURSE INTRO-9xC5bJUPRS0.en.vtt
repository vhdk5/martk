00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It's no surprise that businesses need to

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.419
compete to gain a share of their markets and stay relevant.

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.779
However, it may be surprising to learn that data and

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.980
marketing analysts play an increasingly important role in this competition.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.945
How are market trends shifting?

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:18.585
How are customers reacting to our products?

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.705
What are our forecasted sales into the next quarter?

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:24.674
Where and how do we use our marketing dollars?

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:26.940
These are a handful of questions that

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.510
marketing analysts aim to answer using all of this data.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.910
These analysts frequently need foundational skills in statistics, Excel,

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:38.099
data visualization, so they can make

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.045
the decisions that are most impactful at improving business metrics.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:44.390
In this course, you'll become familiar with

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.100
these tools and the skills needed to become a marketing analyst.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.890
We will first provide a foundation in data and statistics.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.408
Next, you'll dive into these concepts,

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:58.850
and gain skills using spreadsheets with Excel after which,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.929
we'll be exploring data visualizations with Tableau.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.634
In the second half of the course,

00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:05.989
you'll be introduced to Google Analytics,

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:08.224
because websites are core to marketing.

00:01:08.224 --> 00:01:14.530
So having a firm grasp of what and how to find that data will be key in understanding it.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.210
The final section of this course is dedicated to helping you

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.629
parse through all the data and measure what matters most.

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:23.759
Welcome to your marketing analytics journey.
