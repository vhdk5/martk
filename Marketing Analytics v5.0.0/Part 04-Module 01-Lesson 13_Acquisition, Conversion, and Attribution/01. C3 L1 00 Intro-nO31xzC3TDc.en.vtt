00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.889
So far, we reviewed how to implement Google Analytics tracking

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:09.644
on a website and how to study the data in your Google Analytics account.

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:15.029
In this course, we take a more in-depth look into the insights you can get from

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.774
your Google Analytics data with a focus on

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:21.884
understanding how the traffic to your site is acquired,

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:25.530
converts, and how you can attribute acquisition and

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.205
conversion to different acquisition channels like search,

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:32.339
social, display campaigns et cetera.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.734
In this lesson, we will take a closer look at campaign tagging.

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:41.625
Then we will review the different channel definitions in Google Analytics.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:45.920
In lesson three, we will take a look at e-commerce reporting.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.495
Then in lesson four,

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:52.909
we'll learn about the different attribution reports in GA. Lastly in lesson five,

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.884
we will cover a few more advanced reports that can help you get

00:00:56.884 --> 00:01:02.824
better insights into how the pages and events on your site help users to convert.

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:06.079
But first, let's talk about campaign tagging.

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.200
In order to see what marketing action or which

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.210
advertising campaigns are most successful in achieving your goals,

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:17.089
it's important that you label your campaigns in a way that

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.185
allows you to recognize them later in your Google Analytics account.

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:25.820
That labeling is done through the use of UTM tracking codes.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.059
So, let's get started.
