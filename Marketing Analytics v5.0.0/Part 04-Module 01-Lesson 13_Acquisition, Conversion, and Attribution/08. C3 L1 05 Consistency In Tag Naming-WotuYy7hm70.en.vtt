00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
Now that we have a better idea on how UTM tags provide campaign data

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.740
to Google Analytics and the cases where we don't need UTM tags,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.839
let's talk about some considerations for your campaign traffic that does need UTM tags.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.929
So in order to get the most out of your tagging,

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.495
you really want to strive towards consistency.

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:24.105
Consistency within particular channels and consistency across your channels.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:27.120
It is really important and it helps to improve how you

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.255
can bucket your traffic into your appropriate marketing channels.

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:34.439
It helps ensure that you have clean data that is usable in your reporting,

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:37.394
and it's going to make your life a whole lot easier down the road.

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:40.780
So I've just created a little chart here that we can take a look at,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.804
and it takes us down the hierarchy starting with campaign,

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:46.160
and then medium, and then source.

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.644
This chart gives you a visualization of an example where you have a unified campaign,

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:54.500
then why not use a consistent UTM campaign value across that campaign.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.560
So in this case, your holiday free shipping promotion.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.219
Why not in any case where you're promoting that campaign use

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.209
holiday-fs-2018, separated by dashes.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.679
Then going down the chain,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.275
we have in this case a medium of email,

00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:13.870
and a medium of display-rt, paid social media.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.835
So in each of these cases again,

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:18.064
we want to have a different medium to reflect what

00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:20.454
each of those different marketing programs is.

00:01:20.454 --> 00:01:25.969
Keep in mind, once you've decided that UTM medium equals email is going to be for email,

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.405
then you should use that for all of your email marketing efforts.

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:34.775
Similar with if you are going to use display-rt anytime you have displayed retargeting,

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:38.030
then use the same UTM medium value and so forth.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.349
One exception for retargeting is your remarketing campaigns in Google Ads,

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:46.359
which are going to automatically come in as Google CPC.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.064
Then for source.

00:01:48.064 --> 00:01:49.609
So in the case of email here,

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.079
the source of this particular email traffic is your house-file-all-subscribers.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.620
So you want to identify that source clearly.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.180
Many email platforms provide an option for

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.825
automatic UTM tagging for any links contained in the email.

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:06.409
You can take advantage of this option for consistency.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.250
Your displayed retargeting is run through a vendor criteo.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.650
So you might just simplify that with criteo.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.110
Another thing you could do is break that down to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.300
the individual publisher level line items if you had that data available.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.015
To recap briefly, for source,

00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:26.314
you should consistently reflect where particular campaign traffic is coming from;

00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:29.659
Google, Yahoo, Facebook, etc.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.789
Medium should also be consistent,

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.084
but here you are striving for consistent tagging

00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:36.650
relative to particular formats of advertising;

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.230
CPC, CPM, Email, Social, etc.

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:44.929
For campaign, you want to use user-friendly naming conventions

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.740
that are fairly intuitive for somebody seeing that data for the first time.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.800
You want them to be consistent and to be descriptive in

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.740
an abbreviated format that's easy to digest.
