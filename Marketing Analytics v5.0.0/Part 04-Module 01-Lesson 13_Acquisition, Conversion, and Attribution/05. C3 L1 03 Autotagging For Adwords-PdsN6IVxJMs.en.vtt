00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
Let's talk briefly about an instance where you do not need to add

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.015
UTM campaign parameters to your campaign URLs in order to get the best possible tracking.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:12.315
If you're running Google Adswords campaigns for paid search,

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:14.459
the Google Display Network, or YouTube,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.205
you can leverage a function called auto tagging.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:20.264
Auto tagging is turned on by default in Google AdWords.

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.245
So, unless you've turned this off at some point,

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:24.150
it's very likely you don't need to make

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.449
any configuration changes in order to use this functionality.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.489
Let's take a quick look in the AdWords interface,

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.399
so you can see where that setting is.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.274
So, if I click on the account settings tab,

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:37.924
in the top navigation,

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:41.424
I'll be taken to the overall account settings for this AdWords account.

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:43.979
You'll see here an auto tagging setting.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.159
I can see that it's showing yes,

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.894
which means that auto tagging is turned on.

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:51.230
If I expand this box,

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:56.559
I can see this checkbox tagged the URL that people click through for my ad.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.740
When that check box is selected,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.890
it means that auto tagging is turned on.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.994
Again, this will be the default setting in Google AdWords,

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:08.030
so very likely you will not need to update this configuration,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.730
but this is where you will confirm that setting.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.890
So, if auto tagging is turned on,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.314
your campaigns will automatically be appended with a parameter called gclid,

00:01:17.314 --> 00:01:19.579
this is the Google click ID.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.974
This essentially takes the place of UTM tagging for your AdWords campaigns,

00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:27.813
and it encodes a lot of rich information about your AdWords initiatives,

00:01:27.813 --> 00:01:30.069
campaign ad groups, keywords,

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.409
as well as additional information such as placements and

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.314
other targeting options you may have in place for your Google display network campaigns.

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:42.620
You will also want to link your AdWords account to your Google Analytics Property.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.810
This will allow Google Analytics to automatically

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.310
ingest those rich values from the gclid.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.075
Again, there's no need to tag your AdWords URLs with UTM parameters,

00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:55.670
the gclid takes care of that.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.859
You'll be able to see that rich AdWords campaign data in Google Analytics.

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.370
You'll also be able to share

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.359
your Google Analytics conversion goals with your Google AdWords account.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.640
Once the integration is complete and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.465
your campaigns are coming in with the auto tagging in place,

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:12.039
let's just take a quick look.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.620
We're not going to go into detail on campaign performance reports right now,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.534
but I do want to show you really quickly in the interface where you will see

00:02:19.534 --> 00:02:23.905
that Google AdWords data populated by the gclid fed parameter.

00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:25.900
Within the Google Analytics interface,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.330
under the acquisitions tab in the left nav,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.765
you will see there is a Google ad specific drop-down section.

00:02:32.764 --> 00:02:37.114
Here you can see reporting for a number of different AdWords dimensions,

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.230
including at the account level if you have

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:43.324
multiple accounts linked, campaigns, site links,

00:02:43.324 --> 00:02:47.894
bid adjustments, keywords, search queries, day parting,

00:02:47.895 --> 00:02:52.169
final URLs, display targeting settings,

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.700
video campaigns, and chopping campaigns if you're running them.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.405
In addition, your auto tagged Google AdWords traffic

00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:03.515
will also come in and populate your all traffic reports.

00:03:03.514 --> 00:03:06.979
So for example, in source medium,

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.379
you will see that Google ads traffic tagged with

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.259
the gclid is going to get captured within

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:19.484
Google Analytics with the source medium pair Google CPC, line item four.

00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:21.090
Just to be clear,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.875
the source will be Google,

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.909
the medium will be CPC.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.060
The traffic was captured automatically in Google Analytics

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.849
as paid search traffic with the source Google,

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.829
medium CPC, and will be distinguished automatically from Google organic traffic.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.020
Also, if we jump up to the channels report,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.530
we'll see that the classification rules for channels are also going to automatically

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.724
classify the Google CPC traffic as paid search traffic.

00:03:50.724 --> 00:03:55.189
So, this is a case where you don't need to use UTM parameters in order to capture

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:00.319
the data that you need to give you visibility into your marketing campaigns.
