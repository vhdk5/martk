00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.304
Using campaign tags for display, re-marketing, email,

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:09.629
PPC and other campaign types provides several benefits to your Google Analytics tracking.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.170
Properly tagging campaigns with UTM parameters,

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.570
allows you more accurate channel reporting,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.089
source medium reporting, and also

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.975
populates your all campaigns report with data in Google Analytics.

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:25.859
Campaign tracking relies on the UTM tagging building walks.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.769
Source and medium are both required parameters.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.729
Campaign is technically optional but we strongly recommend that you also use

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.669
the UTM campaign parameter in order to provide as

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.645
much rich detail and granularity as possible to your reporting.

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:42.415
Campaign tags, UTM tags,

00:00:42.414 --> 00:00:46.744
and UTM parameters are all terms you may hear in reference to campaign tagging,

00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:49.234
and they all mean the same thing.

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:54.590
Source is typically the website or advertising platform that's sending you the traffic.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.230
For example, Google or Facebook.

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.899
Medium is typically the ad format or

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.244
the ad platform or in some cases the ad pricing format.

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:06.230
So, for example, you might see Banner,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.859
email, or CPC as the UTM medium value.

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.969
Campaign is typically an easily recognizable and abbreviated form

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.605
of the larger ad campaign.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:17.810
Something like holiday 2018,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.954
might be a perfectly valid UTM campaign parameter value.

00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:25.984
Let's take a look at this chart put together by my colleague Eric.

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:29.359
This chart demonstrates how Google Analytics reports data in

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.920
the absence of UTM campaign tagging or other campaign tagging information.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.350
So, looking at this chart we can see there's

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:40.219
some pretty major marketing initiatives that are essentially getting sold short.

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.579
When we don't tag the campaigns properly. What do I mean?

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.989
Well, at the top of the list email many organizations devote

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:50.269
considerable resources and expect

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:53.000
a significant return from their e-mail marketing programs.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.495
In this case if you don't tag your email marketing campaign traffic with UTM parameters,

00:01:58.495 --> 00:02:03.175
that traffic is going to get captured as either direct or referral traffic.

00:02:03.174 --> 00:02:07.924
Not very helpful if you want to actually assess your email campaign performance.

00:02:07.924 --> 00:02:10.729
Similarly, Banner display traffic as well

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.534
as re-marketing display traffic comes in as referral,

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:16.039
in the absence of campaign tracking.

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.069
You can see down the list affiliates will come in

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.799
as referral traffic from the affiliate websites,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.450
that's referring the traffic.

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.864
Unless you tag those affiliate URLs.

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:29.870
We see how important it is based on the default reporting behavior,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.730
that if you want granular detail into

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.629
your campaign performance in the Google Analytics environment,

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.099
you must ensure that you use the building blocks of

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.025
UTM campaign parameters to track your traffic appropriately.

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:44.300
Let's take a look in the Google Analytics interface for a moment,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.330
and see the reporting under the acquisitions tab,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.425
that's impacted by your campaign tagging practices.

00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:52.939
Right now we're looking at

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.750
the default channel groupings report under acquisitions or traffic.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.240
Here we can see typical listings of channels,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.284
from organic search, social, direct,

00:03:02.283 --> 00:03:08.509
referral, paid search, affiliates, display and other.

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:12.459
All of these channels rely on system configure rules,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.000
as well as customizable rules that determine what channel to group this traffic into

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.550
based on the UTM parameters for source medium and in some cases campaign.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.040
So, the more accurate you are with

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:27.859
your tagging practices and the more consistent you are,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.570
the more likely that you'll also get

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.924
accurate default channel groupings without having to do a great deal of customization.

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:37.580
Additionally, under all traffic if we

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.460
look at the source medium reporting at Google Analytics,

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.135
we can also see this is built on the UTM source and UTM medium parameters.

00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:48.679
So, again we do not want to short change ourselves

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.530
in terms of our reporting capabilities in those arenas.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.995
Looking at the all campaigns report under the acquisitions tab,

00:03:54.995 --> 00:03:57.080
we can see a lot of rich detail,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.600
into a very specific campaigns that drove

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.979
not only traffic but transaction activity to the Google merchandise store.

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.979
Just to reiterate this level of campaign detail would not be

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.744
possible without also using UTM source and UTM medium.

00:04:10.745 --> 00:04:15.090
If those tracking parameters are not present even if you use the UTM campaign parameter,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.345
you will not get the expected reporting and that campaign data will be missing.

00:04:19.345 --> 00:04:21.860
So, make sure that you use UTM source and

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.139
UTM medium in conjunction with your UTM campaign parameter,

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.979
and you can see this great level of detail for

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.390
both user behavior and acquisition activity tied to that campaign traffic.
