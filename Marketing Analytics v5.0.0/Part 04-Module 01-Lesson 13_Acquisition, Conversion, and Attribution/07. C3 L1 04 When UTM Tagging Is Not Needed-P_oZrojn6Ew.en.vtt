00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's continue the conversation about when UTM tagging is

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.259
not needed to track your campaign performance in Google Analytics.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.939
As we already discussed,

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:10.529
when you have auto tagging enabled in

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.544
AdWords and your account linked, you do not need it.

00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:17.265
If you happen to be a GA360 user and you have your double-click,

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:21.269
now known as Google Marketing Platform or GMP accounts linked,

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.399
and also auto tagging enabled,

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:27.989
that's another instance where you do not need to use UTM parameters.

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.119
Internal links within your website.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.810
We see this issue fairly frequently and it is not

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.620
a good idea to use campaign tags on your internal links.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.844
It seems like a good idea to track these efforts as campaigns.

00:00:39.844 --> 00:00:42.890
The problem is that you are fragmenting your sessions.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.469
Every time campaign parameters are present in the link,

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.204
you're going to break the session and you're going to start a new session.

00:00:49.204 --> 00:00:51.979
More importantly, you're going to overwrite

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:57.259
that attributed campaign data that you already have associated with that user's cookie.

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:59.269
So, you are in effect overriding

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.240
the actual marketing activities that brought that person to you,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.340
and so you're really damaging your ability to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.829
effectively attribute conversion activities to

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.840
your original marketing sources when you use campaign parameters on your internal links.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.835
So, again, don't do it.

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:17.659
True referral traffic really does not need UTM parameters.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.269
So, if you happen to get a good review on a product

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:23.069
just because somebody purchased your product really liked it,

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.244
they decided to mention it on their personal blog or some other website that they have,

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.900
you didn't devote any marketing dollars to it.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.850
You didn't cultivate that relationship.

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.144
They just decided to put a link to your site.

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:36.979
You don't need UTM parameters for that.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.900
That traffic will get captured as a referral and it really is a true referral,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.260
similar with your organic link building efforts.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.875
If your inbound links,

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:48.474
if they're just naturally acquired,

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.479
somebody liked your website and they link to you,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.490
again, that's true referral traffic.

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:54.799
No need for UTM parameters.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.759
Your earned social media links.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.400
If somebody mentioned you on his personal Facebook profile with a post,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.930
it will get picked up as a social referral.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.630
This is true for referrals from social sites,

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:08.240
but it won't be the case for social apps.
