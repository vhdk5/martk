00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
We've been discussing consistency in your campaign tagging practices.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.259
Let's discuss consistency across marketing teams.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.093
That is, how can you maintain consistent compliance

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:13.469
with your agreed upon tagging practices once they're in place.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.324
This is about people, processes and accountability.

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:19.449
Leverage smart tools of course,

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.949
but it's really how you practice accountability

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.009
toward one another for those agreed upon naming conventions

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.050
that will really allow you to establish

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.100
consistency within and across your marketing teams.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.120
Meet frequently and agree on key tagging taxonomies for

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:41.030
UTM parameters especially the main building blocks of source, medium and campaign.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.450
Use a URL builder tool or spreadsheet to enforce

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.820
that consistency across channels and teams wherever you can.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.030
Again, this isn't a substitute for the people and process part of the equation,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.789
but it can make it easier to share and organize

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.820
this information so that people don't have to go hunting and

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.670
frantically scrambling to find what one team member is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.025
doing or what a particular initiative is supposed to be tagged as.

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:09.109
A spreadsheet such as this utility that I've linked to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.959
from inner makes it really easy to enforce consistency

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.090
in your tagging and to do so in a way that's

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.870
really easily shareable with a team or across teams.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.695
Just to demonstrate, we have a destination URL here,

00:01:21.694 --> 00:01:26.569
www.myexample.site.com and then here I have a list of

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.969
sources and these are going to be only valid sources that we've all agreed on.

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.179
In this case, let's say we're trying to create an affiliate link.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.540
Trade doubler is our affiliate platform,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.445
so we'll choose trade doubler as source.

00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:43.189
For medium, we will choose affiliates.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.549
There's no key word or add content data.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.739
I could add just one URL or I could add multiple URLs at one time

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:58.234
and then I can create a fully tagged tracking URL.

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:05.180
This utility will output a fully tagged tracking URL as well as a minified URL

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.370
which is great for social media tracking in your posts and promoted content.
