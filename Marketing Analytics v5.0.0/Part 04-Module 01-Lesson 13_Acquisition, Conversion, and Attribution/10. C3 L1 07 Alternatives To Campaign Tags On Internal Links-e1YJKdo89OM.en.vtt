00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
We've said this once and we'll say it again,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.165
do not use UTM tags on your internal links on your website.

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:08.939
It introduces unnecessary session breaks and it

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:12.239
also breaks the chain of attribution for your marketing efforts.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.800
You may still want to track calls to action on your website and other kinds of

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.109
merchandising activities that are driving

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.289
transactions from within your own site and key pages.

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.449
There are a couple of alternatives to using

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.140
UTM tags on your internal links which do not break the session,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.710
and these alternatives are internal promotions and custom events.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.799
So, let's talk about internal promotions first.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:36.739
These are part of the enhanced e-commerce tracking feature

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.190
in Google Analytics and they allow you to,

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:42.799
when you have say a banner promotion on your own website or

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:46.969
even just a link to a specific special offer you may be running,

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.899
or you may be doing some internal merchandising to special products sets.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.619
When somebody clicks on those key links to a product for example,

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:58.714
then you can send that along with the e-commerce data for say a product view.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:02.150
You can also send the internal promotion data which will then

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.155
allow you to attribute shopping behaviors to that internal promotion.

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:08.974
So, for example, if you did have, let's say,

00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:12.265
a summer sale banner on your own website on your homepage,

00:01:12.265 --> 00:01:14.025
when somebody clicks on that,

00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:18.280
you would then capture the internal promotion summer sale, 2018.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.989
This allows you to also preserve the chain of

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:23.869
attribution to whatever marketing source brought that person into

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.435
your website while seeing what kind of internal promotion drove action on your website.

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:33.109
Similarly, if you have calls to action on your website,

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.640
clicks to lead inquiry forms or a button to sign up for an account today,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.769
and you want to know if those buttons and those calls to

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:42.125
action are actually generating interest,

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:45.064
or driving behavior that means success for your company,

00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:47.359
you can do that with custom events.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.859
That's not the only use for custom events,

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.859
but custom events are quite flexible and is one of the very good uses for those events.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.284
Custom events can help you track key button and CTA clicks on your site,

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:02.104
whether or not you use enhanced e-commerce tracking.

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:03.500
In an upcoming lesson,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.599
Eric will discuss techniques for seeing

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.319
the supports that events provide to your conversion efforts.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.000
So, let's take a look at some internal promotion data to see how it will display,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.759
and we'll give you some sense of how that might be used as

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:20.465
an alternative to those campaign tags on internal links.

00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:25.129
We'll get into the enhanced e-commerce reporting in greater detail later in this lesson,

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.799
but take a look here under the marketing section of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.620
the e-commerce tab within Google Analytics.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.340
We can see an internal promotion name and then a variety of

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.379
shopping and conversion behavior and metrics associated with those promotion names.

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.620
So if it to say for now that here you can see, for example,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.895
the drink where internal promotion on the Google merchandise site was viewed

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:51.980
approximately 29,000 times and have a handful of clicks.

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:55.310
You can see the click-through rate for that promotion as well as

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.509
how many transactions that drove and the revenue value thereof.

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:01.729
So, this could be really valuable information, and again,

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.549
it does not have to overwrite your campaign tracking in

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.969
order to get this kind of information about your internal promotions.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.939
This is an important option to keep in mind.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.389
Along similar lines, custom events allows you to track

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.569
some key behaviors on your site that are driving value,

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.704
but you wouldn't want them to overwrite your campaign attribution.

00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:22.100
This could be, for example,

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.269
a call to action on the website that drives people to a lead generation form,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.980
or some other deeper content on your site.
