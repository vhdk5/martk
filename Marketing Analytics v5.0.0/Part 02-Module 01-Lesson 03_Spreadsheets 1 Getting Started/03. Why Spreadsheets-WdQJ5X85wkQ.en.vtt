00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
Yes, this is a spreadsheet.

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:05.099
It has columns of data and row entries.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.589
What you need to do with this ledger is something

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.050
like keep a running total of the columns.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.695
Sum the columns for each page and then carry that forward to the next page.

00:00:14.695 --> 00:00:18.120
Oh, forgot something, this makes it electronic.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.375
Right?

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:23.309
Can you imagine how much time it took to keep those spreadsheets up to date?

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:27.984
Tracking sales, inventory accounts or really, any kind of list.

00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:31.379
I'm here at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View where we can

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.289
see firsthand the early platforms used for spreadsheets.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:41.810
In 1979 the first microcomputer spreadsheet VisiCalc came out for the Apple 2,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.645
but it really gained popularity when it was ported to the IBM PC in 1981.

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:51.120
Suddenly, all office workers accounting, engineering, sales,

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:55.829
management could use a PC to track and chart all kinds of data.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.670
This was the first killer app meaning that companies

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.394
started buying IBM PCs just so they could have this application.

00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:06.045
I remember when it happened.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:12.075
Suddenly, we had an area in our office repurposed for several IBM PCs with not one,

00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:14.250
but two floppy drives.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.900
That was A and B,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.905
which the engineers and managers in my office used exclusively

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:23.939
for Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets and word processing apps.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.569
Before spreadsheets, it was a major chore to extract

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:33.119
meaningful information and gain insight about the bigger picture in a company or process.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.920
With a spreadsheet, the data could be moved around, corrected or inserted.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.504
We can add formulas of all kinds to columns or aggregate information from a list,

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:45.599
maybe a sum or an average,

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.314
we could compare information groups within our dataset.

00:01:49.314 --> 00:01:51.420
There are limitations though.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.320
If you have a lot of users at the same time or

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.384
if the data set is very large your performance may suffer.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:02.250
The capacity of a spreadsheet application,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.335
the maximum size of the sheets and how many there can be varies with the application.

00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:11.810
But spreadsheets are easy to obtain and use.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.900
The ability to quickly load,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.300
modify and compare to see your data and what it means is powerful.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.385
This is why you need a good understanding of what you can accomplish with spreadsheets.

00:02:24.384 --> 00:02:25.780
With a little practice,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.789
the process is fast and easy.
