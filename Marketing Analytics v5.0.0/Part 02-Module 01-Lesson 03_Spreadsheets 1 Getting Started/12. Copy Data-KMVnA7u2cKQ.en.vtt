00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's work through some specific manipulation skills.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.269
First step, copy data and open

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.959
a Google Finance web page of Apple historical stock prices.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.780
With spreadsheets, we can copy whole tables.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.179
This works well when a website is set up in

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.649
a format that spreadsheets recognize such as this financial data.

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:22.994
When I copy and paste this table from the financial website,

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:25.530
it's copied and pasted as cells.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.160
Each cell has a separate value. Now you try.
