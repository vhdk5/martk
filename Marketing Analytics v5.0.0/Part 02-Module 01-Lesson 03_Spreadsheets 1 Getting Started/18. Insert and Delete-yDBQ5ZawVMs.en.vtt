Both the home and context menus have options for

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.280
inserting and deleting rows, columns, and cells.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.830
Recall that the context menu appears when you right-click.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.945
Suppose I have another kind of fruit at my fruit stand and I want to add a column for it,

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:18.810
select a column, right-click and insert,

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.519
add your label and you're ready to go.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.509
