00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Always save your work.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.259
There's nothing worse than spending hours on

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.664
a project only to have it disappear because of a power glitch.

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:10.139
If you're using Google Sheets,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.425
your work is saved in the cloud every time you make a change.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:17.010
If you're using a desktop spreadsheet like Excel,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.165
you must be more diligent.

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:25.210
Get in the habit of clicking save frequently or use the shortcut Ctrl+S.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.105
The first time you save your sheet,

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:30.795
the Save As dialog will appear.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:35.115
After that, Excel will know where to go to save your work.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:39.704
The xlsx format is the default Excel format

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:46.079
but there are a number of formats you can save your work in with the pull down menu.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.804
Google Sheets, Apple numbers and Apache Open Office can all open

00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:57.079
xlsx files as well as the older Excel format xls.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, it's your turn to save your work.
