00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.075
We're going to start with simply opening a blank spreadsheet.

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:06.000
If you've reviewed the Getting Started Guide,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.820
this should be straightforward.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.530
In this example, I've opened a new Excel spreadsheet by

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:14.704
clicking on File, New, Blank spreadsheet.

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:18.699
The spreadsheet has a series of columns with letter labels A,

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.175
B, C, and so on.

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:26.568
If you go past Z, they become AA,

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:30.429
AB, AC, and continue in that pattern.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:38.750
Meanwhile, rows are labeled numerically 1,2,3, and so on.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.060
These boxes are called cells.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.215
And each one has an address.

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:46.035
The address of this cell, for example,

00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:50.939
is A1, and this one is E8.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:55.500
You can see that the label boxes are grayed in the E and the 8.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.240
In spreadsheets, you can also have multiple sheets.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.454
Here is the add sheets button.

00:01:01.454 --> 00:01:07.469
I can add sheets easily and even rename them to something more useful.

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:11.879
At first, we're just going to work on one sheet but keep in mind that

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:14.129
the sheet or tab name will become part of

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:18.114
the cell address when we work with multiple sheets.

00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:22.549
The formula bar is your window into a selected cell.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.896
If you start typing into a cell,

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:28.015
you can see your typing appear in the formula bar.

00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:33.314
Alternatively, you could select the cell and type directly into the formula bar.

00:01:33.314 --> 00:01:36.585
Sometimes, you'll be entering a formula as I have here.

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:40.049
I'm adding two cells together by entering an equal sign and

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.310
then selecting each of the cells with a plus sign in between.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.870
If I come back later,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.579
after entering some formulas,

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.239
I can examine a cell by selecting it and see

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:56.319
the formula that's hidden inside by looking at the formula bar.

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.069
Another handy trick is to click on

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.439
the formula bar which highlights all the cells that are used in the formula.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.789
The main menu includes the most custom features of

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.250
the particular spreadsheet application and varies somewhat

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.310
between Google Excel, Apple Numbers etc.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.090
We're going to focus on the features they have in common.That's coming up next.
