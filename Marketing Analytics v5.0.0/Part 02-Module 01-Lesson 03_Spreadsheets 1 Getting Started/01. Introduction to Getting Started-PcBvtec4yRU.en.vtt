00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.215
Hello. My name is Dana Shin,

00:00:02.215 --> 00:00:04.710
and I'll be your instructor for spreadsheets.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.890
I'm an Engineer and Computer Scientist.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.700
I've been using spreadsheets since early in my career when they first came out.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.675
In this introduction to spreadsheets,

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:17.190
we'll focus on how to leverage some of the powerful features that

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.015
makes spreadsheets a must for your data analysis tool box.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.116
Here's how the lessons are organized.

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:24.360
In this first lesson,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.050
I'll give you a little background and then you'll jump right in.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.430
We'll set up a spreadsheet,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.990
go over some major features,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.775
without going into too much depth,

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:34.745
just to get you started.

00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:37.620
If you're already familiar with the basics of spreadsheets,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
it's okay to skip ahead to the exercises and quizzes.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.945
After getting started, we'll focus on how to manipulate data,

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.950
analyze data and finally, visualize data.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.265
Along the way, I'll show you lots of examples,

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:55.680
and you'll have the opportunity to try out what you've

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.070
learned in small exercises and quizzes.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.693
That is, I'll demonstrate a concept or group of features,

00:01:02.693 --> 00:01:08.070
then you'll be given some small challenges in the form of quizzes or exercises.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.991
These are designed to reinforce what you see in the videos,

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:13.410
so be sure to give them a try.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.770
Also, keep an eye out for key terms and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.200
special pro tips in the instructor notes on the shortcuts and time-savers.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.790
Now, you may be wondering which spreadsheet you're going to learn about.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.535
The answer is, any of them.

00:01:29.535 --> 00:01:32.535
I'll be demonstrating with Excel on Windows but,

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:35.460
you're welcome to use any spreadsheet you have ready

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.150
access to when you're trying the quizzes and exercises.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.894
There are a number of different spreadsheet applications out there to choose from,

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:48.630
Microsoft Excel is the most popular and is robust and mature.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.840
Google sheets won't do everything that Excel can,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.600
but it's free and collaborative.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.920
Then, there's Apple numbers and Apache Open Office Calc and more.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.460
The interfaces and some of the details differ between

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.585
spreadsheet applications as well as between computer platforms,

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:10.465
but they share a number of core features and functions.

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:16.260
Your exercises and quizzes in the lessons will use a format that all of these support.
