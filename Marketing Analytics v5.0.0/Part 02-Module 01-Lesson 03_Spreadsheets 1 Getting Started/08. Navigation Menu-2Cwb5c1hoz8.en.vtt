00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
The main menu bar includes a number of sub menus,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.290
on tabs containing the operations and tools that are

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.910
particular to the spreadsheet application you are using.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.199
These are even configurable in Excel as you become more experienced.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.599
I'm going to go through only a few of these in

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.565
Excel to give you an idea of what is available.

00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:26.940
Google Sheets and Apple Numbers have similar operations to the ones I'm mentioning.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.274
But they may be called something different and they may be found in a different location.

00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:36.929
There are a lot of features available in Excel that you won't find in other spreadsheets.

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:43.594
But our intent here is to focus on the features that most spreadsheets have in common.

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:45.585
The more you work with an application,

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:49.120
the easier its features are to find and use.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:52.184
But if you aren't sure, there's always help.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.035
Here it is right on the Home menu.

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:58.941
Type in your search or just click F1.

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:04.492
If I'm looking for something I think might be there or just want more information,

00:01:04.492 --> 00:01:06.479
that's where I go first.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.710
File operations are commands that operate between

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:16.250
spreadsheets and your computer operating system or online environment.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.765
New, we've already used to create a blank spreadsheet but we can also open

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:28.659
an existing spreadsheet or use Save As to save a sheet with a new name or format.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.003
Edit operations are found in a few different places,

00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:34.625
but the major ones are in the Home menu.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:40.260
Undo and Redo are always visible in the Quick Access Toolbar in the upper left corner,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.085
which is also configurable.

00:01:43.084 --> 00:01:46.664
The Home menu includes the clipboard functions,

00:01:46.665 --> 00:01:48.330
Cut, Copy and Paste.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.060
A number of formatting options are also available in the Home menu.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.240
We can set fonts,

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.159
data type and more.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.674
There are also shortcuts for table formatting and adding and deleting rows and columns.

00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:05.819
We'll use these features as we need them in the lessons.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.769
Formatting your data appropriately,

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.219
helps you document and communicate your analysis.

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:16.599
This is also where you'll find Search and Replace operations or Find and Select.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.539
One tip on this one.

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:22.564
Be sure you know the scope of your search or replace.

00:02:22.564 --> 00:02:25.092
Is it just the selected cell or range,

00:02:25.092 --> 00:02:27.764
the whole sheet or multiple sheets?

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:29.849
This is one of those details that may work

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.729
differently on different spreadsheet applications.

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.389
For Excel, a dialog box appears when you

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:41.739
click options that you can use to specify the scope.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:49.629
Insert menu includes some special items such as hyperlinks.

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.764
One very important insert function we'll be using a lot is the chart.

00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:57.059
Creating a chart in spreadsheets is

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.375
an Insert operation because the chart will by default,

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:03.344
be inserted into the page you're working on.

00:03:03.344 --> 00:03:07.615
We will also cover Pivot Tables in a later lesson.

00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:09.560
The Data menu, as you might guess,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.879
includes some important features for data scientists.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.995
These commands allow us to filter our data files,

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:19.414
sort lists, and split columns.

00:03:19.414 --> 00:03:23.000
We'll use these data tools in later lessons.
