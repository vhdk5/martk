Congratulations.

00:00:01.665 --> 00:00:04.710
You've completed the first lesson and learned the basics.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.285
You now have a good idea of what spreadsheet applications can do and why they're useful.

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:14.484
You're aware of some of the universal features that all spreadsheets have.

00:00:14.484 --> 00:00:16.484
You understand columns, rows,

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:18.464
and addressing in spreadsheets,

00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:21.859
and you've built and saved a simple spreadsheet.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.000
Next, we'll manipulate data with lots of new functions. See you soon.
