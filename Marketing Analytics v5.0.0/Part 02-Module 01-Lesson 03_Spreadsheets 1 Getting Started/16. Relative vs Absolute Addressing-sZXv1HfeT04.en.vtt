00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.044
Let's take a look at this little fruit stand example.

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:06.254
I have a column of apple sales and one of orange sales.

00:00:06.254 --> 00:00:09.179
To find out how many total fruit I've sold in each order,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.384
I'll create a new column called fruits.

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:15.300
I'll make a formula that adds the apples and oranges for the order,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.990
then fill down so that each row has a sum in the column.

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.094
Taking a closer look at the cells,

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:30.838
it turns out that filled formulas have different addresses for each row.

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:38.649
These addresses are relative addresses.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.714
They are relative because I'm adding together the cell two to the left,

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:46.120
plus the cell one to the left for my answer cell.

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:48.280
If I copy it or fill it down,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.859
the answer cell will always look at the cell two to

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.725
the left plus the cell one to the left and add them.

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:58.375
What if I copy the fruit sum cell to some random place?

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:02.045
The cells referenced are still relative to the answer cell,

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:05.585
two to the left and one to the left.

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:07.989
It's important to be aware of this default behavior in

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:11.459
spreadsheets because it's not always what we want.

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:12.789
Let's try a different problem.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.925
Suppose I have some prices set up for our apples and oranges,

00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:19.524
and now I want to know the total income for each order.

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:21.265
The formula is pretty straightforward.

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:23.034
The number of apples times the price,

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:25.709
plus the number of oranges times the price.

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:31.524
There that looks right. Now, just fill it down.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:33.545
Well, something went wrong.

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:35.260
If we look at the formula,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.075
we can see what it was.

00:01:37.075 --> 00:01:42.504
The relative address was assumed for the price as well as the daily fruit totals.

00:01:42.504 --> 00:01:46.579
So the price reference for the apples is always three cells to the right,

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.792
and the price reference for the oranges is always one cell down from there,

00:01:50.793 --> 00:01:53.385
and that is not what we want.

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:58.120
What we want is to always absolutely use

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.475
the cell H2 for apple prices and H3 for orange prices.

00:02:03.474 --> 00:02:06.699
What we need is an absolute address for the prices.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.795
An absolute address is fixed and won't change when it's copied or filled.

00:02:11.794 --> 00:02:15.099
And that is accomplished by entering a dollar sign in

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.759
front of both the column and row in the address.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:24.084
The dollar sign in front of the letter tells Excel that the column is fixed,

00:02:24.085 --> 00:02:29.305
and the dollar sign in front of the number tells Excel that the row is fixed.

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:31.060
For the price references,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.645
I'll put a dollar sign in front of both the column letter and the row number.

00:02:34.645 --> 00:02:38.743
So both the column and row for the price cells are absolute addresses.

00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:40.044
When I fill down,

00:02:40.044 --> 00:02:43.194
the price addresses for the formulas won't change.

00:02:43.194 --> 00:02:47.340
They'll stay H2 and H3.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.650
Now, looking at the formulas,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.000
we can see that the cells referenced are the ones we want.
