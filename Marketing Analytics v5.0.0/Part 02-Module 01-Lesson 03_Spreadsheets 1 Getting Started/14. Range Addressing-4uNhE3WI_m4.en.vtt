00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
You've already figured out by now that a group of cells is called a range.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.610
The address of a cell or a range is required when we

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.570
want to reference that cell or range in a formula or chart.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.095
So how do we reference a particular range in Excel?

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:21.135
Select a range by holding down your mouse button and swiping or dragging.

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:24.630
This selects a group of cells that are next to each other which can be

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.763
used to make a chart which we will explore in the visualize data lesson.

00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:32.355
Or to add formatting such as cell highlighting or font color,

00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:34.635
many choices for formatting.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.514
Or for inclusion in a Formula.

00:00:37.514 --> 00:00:43.430
One way to see this is to look at how range is referenced in a simple formula using sum.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.660
In this example, we'll create a formula that's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.715
just equal sign then type sum and then select a range.

00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:53.715
The range address shows up in the formula.

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:58.370
A range is defined by the upper left and lower right corners of the area selected.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.440
In this example, we can see that the range is from

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.115
B2 in the upper left to C7 in the lower right.

00:01:05.115 --> 00:01:08.730
The range corners are separated by a colon to indicate,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.370
and everything in between.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.790
In addition to selecting ranges by column and row labels,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.085
it is also possible to name ranges to make them easier to read and identify.

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:23.150
You'll learn about that in a later lesson.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.610
Next, I want to show you something else that's

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.755
special about addressing with spreadsheets.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:34.000
That's the idea of relative versus absolute addressing.
