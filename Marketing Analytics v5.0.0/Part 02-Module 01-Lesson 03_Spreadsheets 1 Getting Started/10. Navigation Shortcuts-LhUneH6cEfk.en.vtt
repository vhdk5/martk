00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
In addition to the many commands,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.445
tools and functions included in spreadsheets,

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:08.355
there are some special spreadsheet gestures to learn.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.009
For spreadsheets specifically, we can

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.029
fill additional cells with copies or continued patterns.

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.160
The fill command isn't typed in anywhere,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.129
rather, it's a mouse dragging gesture.

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:23.339
Select a cell or range,

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.804
hover over the lower right corner until a plus sign appears,

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:28.769
that's the fill handle.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.939
Press the mouse button and drag to fill.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.870
The result is a repeated copy of values, sequences or formulas.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:40.879
This is especially helpful if we have a formula we want to repeat.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.105
And another useful shortcut is the context menu.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:48.279
Open a context menu of quick functions that can

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.270
be applied to your selection with the right-click of your mouse.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.640
Finally, keep in mind that a number of

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.070
keyboard shortcuts that you're used to using

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.664
on your computer also work with spreadsheets,

00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:02.284
like undo and redo.

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:05.019
You'll find that these can be real time-savers.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.479
That's what we're trying to do for spreadsheets,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.920
make it all easier so we can get past the calculations and focus

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.000
on data analysis and finding the meaning behind the data in our spreadsheets.
