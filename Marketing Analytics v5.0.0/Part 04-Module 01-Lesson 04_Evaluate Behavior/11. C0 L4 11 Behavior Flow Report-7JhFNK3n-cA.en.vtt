00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
Behavior flow reports are very helpful when you want to study the behavior of

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.900
your visitors a little more closely based on how they navigate from page to page.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.269
Here's what the reports look like.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.199
By default, you see the flow grouped by brands.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.835
Let's switch this to a page by page view, like so.

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:24.885
We've seen this report before when we looked at user flow.

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:27.090
It shows you how people who,

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.829
for instance land on the homepage,

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.274
navigate to a next interaction.

00:00:31.274 --> 00:00:35.070
This report also gives you another way to look at exits.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.575
The red drop-offs are exits,

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:40.830
and if you see a thick exit line in the beginning of a flow,

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.265
you may want to take a closer look.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:48.230
You can see here again that the sign-in page stands out in that respect.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.119
Many exit from here.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.519
This report is also a good way to study with

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.620
the expected next step is of your users for any page they may be on.

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.649
That's exactly what I did for the lifestyle site.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:07.099
I looked at the expected next page after the user-generated pre-post design examples.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:09.769
It was clear from that that there was a higher probability for

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:13.405
users to navigate to the designer look books next.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:18.030
You can select individual pages to look at here.
