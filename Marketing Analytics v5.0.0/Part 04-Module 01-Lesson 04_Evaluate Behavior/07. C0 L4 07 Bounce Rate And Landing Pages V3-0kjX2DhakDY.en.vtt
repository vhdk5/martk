00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
There are of course a few different ways you could go about that question.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.290
One possible approach is as follows.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.000
You take a look at the most popular pages and their engagement metrics.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.675
First and foremost, I'm going to check out the bounce rates.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:17.324
If visitors are bouncing,

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:18.884
I'm clearly not engaging them.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.790
So, that's something to worry about.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.789
Overall, these bounce rates don't look too bad,

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.259
but among the top 10 pages,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.975
there are two pages I believe could do better.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:30.285
First, the store page.

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:32.750
It has a relatively high bounce rate.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.509
But for the people who do make it pass the landing page,

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:37.820
it looks like the sessions are typically long

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.369
as the average session duration is over three minutes.

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:44.394
So, this page may be a good candidate to further evaluate.

00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:47.930
Unfortunately, we can't see the actual page based on the data here,

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.170
but let's assume that your colleagues at Google would know.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.260
Second, the page that carries YouTube branded

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:57.250
merchandisers also performing a bit below par.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.170
So, this page deserves some attention too.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.159
So, those would be the two pages you could suggest looking at first.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.280
There's one other approach that I would like to show you.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.420
It takes a bit of a higher level view of the landing pages.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.430
You can decide to group the pages by category.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.340
We've done this in advance here.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.570
This is the report for the landing pages by product category.

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.379
When I look at the bounce rates now,

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:27.394
there's one content category that's clearly standing out, electronics.

00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:30.530
This is a high bounce rate of over 60 percent.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.700
That's interesting information as it shows me that something makes people come to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.560
pages in the electronics product category and then leave again immediately.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.980
Let's take a look at this main electronics page.
