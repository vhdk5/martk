00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.394
Landing pages are the pages where people first enter your site.

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:07.769
Any page of your site could be a landing page,

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.189
it's very important to remember that when you manage a website.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.039
We often think of the homepage as the landing page

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.460
as you often design it to be the first interaction with your site,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
but people don't always enter your site through the homepage.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.725
Actually, these days, you see an increasing amount of traffic bypassing the home page.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:29.779
Why? Because people search for specific content or products,

00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:32.914
and they click on the exact link to what they're looking for.

00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:35.689
No need to check out the homepage first,

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:41.390
or links to content on your site are being shared on platforms like Facebook,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.505
and people click the link to for instance,

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:45.859
a news article on The New York Times,

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.229
they don't see the New York Times homepage.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.549
So, every page of your site can be a landing page.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:58.354
It's important to checkout which of your pages function most often as landing pages.

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:01.194
You can do that in the landing pages report.

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:04.189
Here, we can see for any page on the site,

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.299
how many sessions started with this page as the landing page.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.314
In this case, for the Google merchandise store,

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:14.060
the homepage is the main landing page,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.475
and it looks like during the month of August,

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:20.244
the men's t-shirt page was an important landing page too.

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.355
Note how this can change,

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:25.640
as new links to your site gets shared different pages

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.355
may become more popular landing pages.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:32.255
You also get an estimate of the percentage of first-time visits here,

00:01:32.254 --> 00:01:35.089
percent new sessions, and the number of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.005
new visitors to the site that started their session through this page.

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.390
The second part of the report provides us with

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.405
the related engagement metrics for the landing pages.

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:45.935
These are important.

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:50.290
If these pages are the first interaction your users have with your site,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.555
then you want to make sure they engage with the pages.

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:55.585
That could mean different things.

00:01:55.584 --> 00:01:57.449
Spending time on the page,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.719
as we saw before,

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.129
that is really important for content pages

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:03.935
like blog posts for instance, or news articles.

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:07.490
You want people to take time reading and watching your content.

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.764
Engagement could also mean navigating deeper into the site.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:15.498
Ideally, people don't stop after visiting the landing page alone,

00:02:15.498 --> 00:02:19.444
but they navigate from that landing page to other pages in your site.

00:02:19.444 --> 00:02:23.794
In this section, you find the average session duration metric.

00:02:23.794 --> 00:02:27.199
This refers to the average time the user spends in

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.829
the session that started with this landing page.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.099
You also find the pages per session metric,

00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:37.159
which refers to the average number of pages viewed

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.935
during a session that started with this landing page.

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:45.110
Sometimes this metric is referred to as, The page depth.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.270
There's one metric in the engagement section that's super important, the bounce rate.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.250
You can look at this as the anti engagement metric.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.909
Bouncing refers to a user coming to your site and

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.914
immediately leaving again without interacting with any content.

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:04.030
When we say interacting with the content,

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.409
we mean clicking on a link,

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.620
or launching an events like for instance, playing a video.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.620
Very often, a bounce happens when a user comes

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.409
into your site by clicking on a search engine result,

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.289
and then leaves immediately using the back button.

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.870
In some cases, bounces happen because there's just

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.004
nothing else for the user to do on the page they landed on,

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:24.490
no link to click on,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.275
no interesting next step.

00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:29.530
So, the main two reasons for bouncing are

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.580
a mismatch between user expectation and what a site offers,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.950
or the page design does not engage further.

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.959
Bounces are bad. It is really

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.260
the user's way of saying that they did not like what they saw,

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:43.909
or that it was not relevant to them,

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.159
or not good enough to continue spending time.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.090
So, you have to avoid bounces from happening.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.830
So, you might wonder what a high bounce rate is.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.100
To some extent, you may determine what you think is acceptable.

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.889
If you see more than 50 percent of the people who enter

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.579
your site leave immediately without looking at any other page,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.625
you may find that unacceptable, but on the other hand,

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:08.030
you will always have a certain level of bouncing on your site.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.349
J Peyton, at Rocket fuels studies this in a little bit more detail.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.969
He compared over 60 different sites and looked at their average bounce rate.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.745
This graph represents the distribution he found.

00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:24.090
The average bounce rate is somewhere between 45 and 55 percent.

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:26.799
If you see a lower bounce rate, that's great.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.435
If your bounce rate is over 55 percent,

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:32.339
you may want to look into improving your landing page.
