00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
Let's first take a look at

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.595
the behavior overview report for the Google online merchandise store.

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:07.139
You can find it here.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:11.000
You get a general sense here of how much of your content is consumed,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.845
and how engaging your content is on average.

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:15.330
Over the month of August,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.600
the site got a total of 362 page views,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.570
of which 242,000 were unique,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.649
meaning that they were not views of the same page during one session.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:30.164
If a user sees a page in a session and then later sees that page again,

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:32.844
for instance, because they use the back button,

00:00:32.844 --> 00:00:36.049
that view would not be counted as a unique page view.

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:40.729
We also see what the average time spent is and the average bounce rate,

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.989
those are two metrics that indicate how engaging your content is to the user.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.929
Now, here we see the average time spent,

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.075
which is not super informative,

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:52.085
especially on an e-commerce site.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.259
I have a mix of pages on the site,

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:57.589
some of them I would expect the user to take some time for,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.030
but there are others like

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.630
my checkout page that I would hope don't take too long to digest.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.670
We'll come back to these engagement metrics in

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.195
more detail when we study them for the individual pages.

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:12.469
Here below we get a summary of what the behavior report cover,

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.989
you can study the site content.

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:16.893
We can look at it by the page,

00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:18.050
or by page title,

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.804
or by content group.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:22.160
Content groups are groups that you may have

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.310
assigned to certain pages in the Google Analytics set-up.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.129
You could choose to group pages by brand,

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:29.949
by product, by type,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.204
by contents section, et cetera.

00:01:32.204 --> 00:01:36.424
Basically, these are groups that makes sense from your company's point of view.

00:01:36.424 --> 00:01:42.534
We can also study site search which relates to searches that happen on the actual site.

00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:46.459
Then there is this report that provides information on events.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.739
Events relate to user interactions that are tracked independently from a webpage.

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.373
For instance, video views,

00:01:53.373 --> 00:01:55.414
PDF downloads, et cetera.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:58.490
If your page has these types of interactions,

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.250
you can get more information about them here.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.549
Keep in mind events need extra code on top of

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.054
the typical Google Analytics tracking code

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:09.715
to be added to the site in order to track them.

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:12.349
