00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.015
That brings us to the end of this lesson.

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:05.910
You now know how to study the behavior of the visitors of

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.120
your site and how to use the information you find

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.969
in the Behavior Reports to improve your site to

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.525
help users navigate through it and engage with your content.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:16.754
In the next lesson,

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:18.599
we will focus on assessing whether

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.080
the user's behavior leads to your desire to conversions or actions.
