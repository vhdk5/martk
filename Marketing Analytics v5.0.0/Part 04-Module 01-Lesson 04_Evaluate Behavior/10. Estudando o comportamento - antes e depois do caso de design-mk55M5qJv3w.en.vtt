00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.694
There's one more report I would like to explore in a bit more detail.

00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:06.060
But first, let me tell you a story.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:11.314
A while back I was consulting for a large and successful lifestyle website.

00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:15.329
They were ready to redesign their website and they wanted some help.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.184
I sat down with one of their main salespeople.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:21.309
He told me they had made a few decisions already.

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:24.849
There was an area of the website with lots of pictures sent in

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.855
by users of the site where they showcased their remodel.

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:32.579
Now the sales guy did not like this part of the site at all

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.125
because it was incredibly hard to sell advertising for this section.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:39.990
None of the big appliance brands that he talked to,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.825
wanted to have their ads appear next to someone's new but not so great looking kitchen.

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:49.484
So they decided this area had to go.

00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:51.509
Now when we dug into Google Analytics,

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:58.329
it became clear that this pre-post remodeling content was very popular with users.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.804
They were some of the most visited pages and these pages were engaging,

00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:06.540
low bounce rates, long time spent, et cetera.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.325
But what was more,

00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:10.094
when we looked at the page flow,

00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:11.789
we noticed that in many cases

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.585
the second interaction was with content in the designer section,

00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:18.564
where designers were showcasing their remodels.

00:01:18.564 --> 00:01:23.325
Of course this area was way more slick and very popular among advertisers.

00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:25.950
So I sat down again with a salesperson and I told

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.385
him I thought the user-generated content should stay.

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:34.650
These were pages that inspired users to check out some of the designer's pages.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.615
And instead of making them disappear,

00:01:36.614 --> 00:01:40.579
we should promote them, make them more prominent and easy to find.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.640
But I also told him that he should not be worried about pushing them in a sales call.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.890
He should use them as a traffic driver to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.445
the areas that mattered more to him and to his clients,

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:53.229
the designer showcase pages.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.270
And so the user-generated content pages were saved and they drove

00:01:57.269 --> 00:02:02.500
an increasing amount of traffic to the areas that paid off for the company.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.469
So which report in Google Analytics helped me to figure this out?

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.270
The behavior flow report,

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.090
in the behavior reports section helps to get

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.030
a view on how people flow from one page to the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.030
next and what the role is of a page in flowing

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.030
traffic to other important pages. Let's take a look.
