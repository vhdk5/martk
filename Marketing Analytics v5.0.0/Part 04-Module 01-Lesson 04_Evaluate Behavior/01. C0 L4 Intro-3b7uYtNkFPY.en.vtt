00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
In the previous lessons in this course,

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:06.195
we have covered the basics behind Google Analytics.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:08.400
We looked at how you evaluate,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.769
how much traffic comes to your site,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.230
and who the people are that are visiting.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.978
We then learn to evaluate where the visitors came from,

00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:19.919
which marketing channels brought them to your site.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.755
Now, we're going to take a look at what visitors

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:25.695
are doing on your site once they land at there.

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:27.929
You can use Google Analytics to find out,

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.660
and we will show you how in this lesson.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.520
Here's what you'll learn.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.880
You will go over the commonly used definitions,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.900
then we'll learn how to find your most popular and most engaging content.

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.489
We will take a close look at landing pages,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.725
and we will also combine what we learned about

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:49.620
acquisition channels with what we see in user behavior.
