00:00:02.089 --> 00:00:07.910
A last report in the group of site content reports is the exit report.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.490
I said before that I don't think this is the most helpful report you can find here,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.410
but now that we have talked about bounces a lot,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.109
I want to pause and make sure we get a difference between an exit and a bounce.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.989
Remember how we said that a bounce is a visit where

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.294
the person left your site from the entrance page.

00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:30.995
Basically, they enter your site and immediately leave.

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:34.550
A page is bounce rate does refers to the percentage of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:38.404
visits where this page is the only page in the session.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.579
An exit is different,

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.394
it means the user exits from this page

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:47.895
regardless of how many pages the user visited in that session.

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:53.620
So a bounce would be considered an exit but not every exit is a bounce.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:54.979
When we study pages,

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.129
we talk about the bounce suite and the percent exits,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.000
and here is a refresher on the definitions.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.629
The bounce rate is the percentage of single page visits,

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:08.594
so visits in which the person left your site

00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:12.780
from the entrance page without interacting with the page.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.835
Percent exits is the number of exits

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:22.064
divided by the number of page views for the page or a set of pages.

00:01:22.064 --> 00:01:24.980
It indicates how often users exit from

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.425
that page or set of pages when they view the pages.

00:01:29.424 --> 00:01:32.189
Now just so we're all clear on the difference,

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.019
let's take another look at an example,

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:36.399
this time for Bamboo HR.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.215
First, let's look at what a bounce looks like.

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:42.245
For the sake of this example,

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:45.563
we choose the pricing page as the landing page.

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:49.260
And because the visitor left immediately after landing on

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.130
this page without any other interaction on the page,

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:55.469
for instance, clicking on a link,

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.329
discounts towards the bounce rate for the pricing page.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.974
And since the visitors came to my site and left,

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:08.549
it also counts towards the exit rate for this pricing page.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.215
Now let's take a look at an exit that's not a bounce.

00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:17.700
In this case, the landing page is the home page and the visitor goes

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:22.579
beyond this page interacting with it by clicking on the pricing link.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.560
The visitor that lands on the pricing page and decides to exit by typing in another URL.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.879
So discounts towards an exit for the pricing page,

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:38.229
but this is not a bounce since there was more than one page in the session.

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:40.384
As I said before,

00:02:40.384 --> 00:02:42.564
users need to exit at some point,

00:02:42.564 --> 00:02:47.504
it's normal and those exits are going to be distributed across your site.

00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:52.560
However, if you see disproportional exits on pages that are part of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.930
a conversion or check-out path or that represents a clear beginning of an action,

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.140
then you may want to take a closer look.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.314
In the example we just walked through,

00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:06.775
if many people are exiting from this pricing page,

00:03:06.775 --> 00:03:10.319
Bamboo HR may find that it is not achieving its goals with

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.594
this page as it is clearly meant to get users to submit information.

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:17.609
In that case, they may want to test

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.140
different versions of this page and see whether they would do better.
