00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
There are a few more reports under the behavior section.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.939
First, there is the site speed report.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.899
Here you'll find all the information on page load times,

00:00:10.898 --> 00:00:14.500
load times of links in your pages, et cetera.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.265
Page load times are important for the user experience.

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:20.739
Users are not patient,

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.350
and if your page takes too much time to load,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.695
they'll leave the site even before they see the page.

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:30.010
This report will help you find out which pages take

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.490
too long to load so you can work on fixing them.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.370
It's often a good idea to check the load time for pages with high bounce rates,

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:44.729
just to make sure users are not leaving because the page took too long to load.

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:49.879
Load times are important from a search engine optimization point of view.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.880
Google judges the quality of landing pages,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.700
and if your landing pages take too long to load,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.655
they may punish you for that in the rankings.

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:02.509
It's worth using these reports to understand which pages

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:06.289
to prioritize for page load time reduction.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.435
You can learn more about the site speed reports at the link in the classroom.

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:16.984
The site search report gives you more detail on the searches that happen on your site.

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:19.590
Most sites have a search function built in,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.040
and it's interesting to take a look at what people are

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.955
searching for when they're on the website.

00:01:24.954 --> 00:01:29.140
It gives you clues to what is of interest to people and it may also give

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.265
you some hints about what you may want to feature on your homepage,

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:35.454
on a product overview page,

00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:39.730
and it will make it easier for people to find the things they're looking for.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.685
We talked about events before.

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:45.129
These are different from pages,

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:47.890
but they are interactions with your website.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.239
Common events are; watching a video,

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:52.934
clicking on a promo button,

00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:55.840
downloading a PDF, and others.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.530
In order for events to be tracked by Google Analytics,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.890
you need to instruct Google Analytics to do so.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.530
For that, you need to add code for the different events you want to track.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.129
They are not tracked by default.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.109
In this report, you'll find an overview of how many times your events occurred,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.215
which events are most popular,

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:19.805
and how many sessions have an event.

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:23.825
There's one other report link here, the publisher report.

00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:29.750
This is where you can find reports on the advertising that has been served on your site.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.444
This is a report meant for advertising supported publishers.

00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:37.685
The Google merchandise store is an e-commerce site,

00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:39.485
it does not carry ads.

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:40.625
So in this case,

00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:42.319
we can't see the report.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.840
If you want to learn more about this report,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.870
you can find information at the link in the classroom.
