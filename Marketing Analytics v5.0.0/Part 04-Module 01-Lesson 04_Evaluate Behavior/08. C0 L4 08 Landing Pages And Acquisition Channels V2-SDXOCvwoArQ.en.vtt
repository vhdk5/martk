00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
Now that you have a better sense of how to evaluate landing pages.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.265
It's a good idea to look back at our previous lesson about acquisition channels.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:12.105
Acquisition channels and landing pages go hand in hand.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:14.714
Imagine yourself in the shoes of a marketer.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:18.359
If you're making decisions around which marketing channels to use,

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.239
you're going to have to think about the landing pages

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.794
you will send users to when they come visit your site.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.450
Depending on the channel and your goals,

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.239
you may want to pick different landing pages.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.689
Now, it is important to evaluate them together.

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:36.765
So, how did we do that in Google Analytics?

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:41.134
Let's go back to the landing page report for the Google Merchandise Store.

00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:44.030
Google Analytics makes it possible to bring in

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.134
a secondary dimension when looking at reports.

00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:49.924
There are many dimensions to pick from.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:53.164
We're interested in the traffic source in this case.

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:58.325
Now, Google will show me the traffic by landing page by source.

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:01.640
This extra detail can reveal a few things about

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.930
the match between my acquisition channel in the landing page.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.800
Let's take a look at some of the things we can learn from this report.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.359
Remember that in our quiz,

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.599
we said that the bounce rates for the landing pages looked good overall.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:17.609
Well, let's take a look at this.

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.935
While things looked good on average,

00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:25.984
we have a 69 percent bounce rate on the homepage associated with the YouTube source.

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:30.670
This means that people who come from YouTube and land on the homepage bounce a lot.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.200
That's a problem especially since

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.090
YouTube is an important source of traffic for this page.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.730
Now, I know that there is not really something wrong about page

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.020
itself as it looks like the people who come from other sources do just fine.

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:47.314
They engage, not too many bands,

00:01:47.314 --> 00:01:48.935
and their sessions are along.

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:50.795
So, what is going on here?

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:54.739
This is a clear case of a mismatched expectation.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.339
Let's take a look. We saw before that the traffic to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.070
the merchandise store coming from YouTube is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.429
primarily coming from the About page in YouTube.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.975
There's a link here to merchandise,

00:02:06.974 --> 00:02:10.759
and it says that there's a whole store here filled with YouTube goodies.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.459
Well, if I'm a YouTube fan, I'm excited.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.094
But when I click on the link,

00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:17.500
I find a store full of Google goodies.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.349
No YouTube brand and stuff here.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.344
So, I move on, disappointed.

00:02:21.344 --> 00:02:24.590
It's true that I could have found a YouTube apparel by clicking

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.830
on the shop by brand link and then on YouTube,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.430
but you cannot rely on the user taking those steps.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.655
You should always aim to fulfill their expectation immediately.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.080
So in this case,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.745
the landing page should have been the YouTube branded merchandise page,

00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:43.085
not the homepage of the store.

00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:46.310
You see how combining the landing page report with

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.580
the secondary dimensions source can help you to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.640
evaluate whether you're matched the landing pages

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.809
well with your acquisition efforts in different channels.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.629
It's an important step to take in evaluating

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.019
the engagement of your users from all sources.
