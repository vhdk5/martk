00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.514
This lesson focuses on view settings and view filters.

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:07.889
We'll start off by considering the differences between

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:11.459
view settings and filters, versus custom segments.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.160
We'll talk about the important best practice of

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.370
maintaining at least three views per property,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.015
and then we'll get into some specific settings and filtering such

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:26.804
as excluding your internal traffic, lowercasing several dimensions,

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:31.754
specifying the default page to rewrite that ubiquitous forward slash,

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:35.909
consolidating your URLs for easier analysis,

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:39.929
configuring site search, breaking out country

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.960
specific organic search sources and finally,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.600
using filters to create dedicated subsets of your data.
