00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Earlier, we said that filters can be used for cleaning up our data and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.315
also for creating dedicated subsets of our data in separate views.

00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:12.449
Let's take a look now at how we would achieve this.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:17.399
There are many types of filters that we could apply to create dedicated views.

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:21.254
Again, these views are going to be hard-filtered,

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.864
unlike segments which are dynamic.

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:30.945
We could filter by geography, technology, acquisition, sub-directory,

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:35.075
or hostname, which is especially relevant for a roll-up

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:39.820
or cross domain scenario as far as discussed in the last course.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.079
The process for sub-setting your data into a dedicated view is straightforward.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.060
First, you can create a new view or copy your main view.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.520
In either case, the view will be empty in terms of data.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.315
Then you apply and include or potentially an exclude filter.

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:02.344
There are 25 use per property.

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:07.489
So, let's say that we are creating a dedicated view for our visitors from Australia.

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:10.214
We could click Create View,

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:14.189
View Name, Australia, that's good.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.819
In this case, for reporting time zone,

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.599
we could keep that to wherever the organization is located:

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:25.079
Create View, Filters, Add Filter.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.900
In this case, it's probably okay to add the filter directly to the view without

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.960
going through a TextView because you're not altering your main view.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.459
So, if there happens to be a problem with the filter,

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.179
it will only affect this dedicated Australia view and not your main view.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.165
Filter Name, Australia Only,

00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:55.830
Custom, Include, Filter Pattern, Australia, that's it.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.424
Save the filter and we should be good.

00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:02.265
As a note, exclude filters are cumulative,

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:06.125
meaning that if we wanted a view that included all visitors

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:10.594
except visitors from Australia and except visitors from New Zealand,

00:02:10.594 --> 00:02:16.629
we could apply an exclude Australia filter and then an exclude New Zealand filter.

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.835
However, if we wanted to include visitors from

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:23.135
Australia and New Zealand in a single-view,

00:02:23.134 --> 00:02:28.354
we could not use to succeeding include filters because they're not cumulative.

00:02:28.354 --> 00:02:33.905
If we added an include Australia filter all other countries would go away.

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:38.074
So adding include New Zealand would serve no purpose.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.589
What we'll we need?

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.425
You guessed it, a simple regular expression.

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:53.400
If we go back to our Australia filter and modify it for Australia and New Zealand.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.310
Now, the filter pattern can be Australia or pipe symbol,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.284
New Zealand and we're good.

00:03:03.284 --> 00:03:05.944
As another note about dedicated views.

00:03:05.944 --> 00:03:09.754
In some cases they work hand in hand with access rights.

00:03:09.754 --> 00:03:14.930
Let's say that you wanted to limit access to Google Analytics just for

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.590
a specific sub-directory for a department in your company

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.284
or to a single traffic source for an affiliate.

00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:28.689
We could create dedicated views and then limit access rights only to those views.

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.050
Again, demerits we'll be talking about access rights in the next lesson.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.900
For now, just to see how we would subset our data by sub-directory.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.835
Let's say that we wanted to create a view for

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:44.135
only pages within the products sub-directory.

00:03:44.134 --> 00:03:49.114
We could click Create New View, Product Pages Only,

00:03:49.115 --> 00:03:51.469
go back into Filters,

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.884
Add Filter, Product Pages Only,

00:03:54.884 --> 00:03:56.310
same name as the view.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.210
That's okay. In this case,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.620
we could actually use

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.465
a predefined filter traffic to the sub-directories that begin with products.

00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:10.235
So we could define our view,

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:13.970
and if we wanted to restrict the access only to this view,

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.960
that's where access rights come in.
