00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
In most cases, we do want to keep

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.800
our own organizations activity out of our main working view.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.339
Even though IP address does not appear anywhere in the Google Analytics UI,

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.025
it is available as a filter field.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:17.054
In some cases, for larger organizations,

00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:21.509
you may use ISP domain or ISP organization.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.725
Before you start on the process for filtering out your internal traffic,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.675
check with your network admins,

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:31.455
and they can guide you on which of these three fields you can use.

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:33.765
As we said though, in most cases,

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:36.119
you will filter by IP address.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.214
So, let's use that example.

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:41.210
When you and your colleagues access the Internet,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.804
in most cases you're assigned an IP address

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:47.570
within a range that corresponds to your organization.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.844
This IP address range will be the basis of our filter.

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:55.644
How do we express a range within one filter?

00:00:55.645 --> 00:00:58.220
We certainly don't want to have to create

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.134
15 different filters to exclude our internal traffic.

00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:06.459
If you're thinking regular expressions, you're exactly right.

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:08.719
We'll make sure that we're in our text view,

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.799
not in our main view,

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.284
not in our backup view.

00:01:11.284 --> 00:01:14.465
Click Filters, Add Filter,

00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:20.049
exclude internal IP addresses.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.959
For filter type, there are predefined and custom.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.034
There are some predefined filters that we can use,

00:01:27.034 --> 00:01:29.219
including traffic from the IP addresses,

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.094
but we're going to go right to custom and configure our filter from there.

00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:37.275
We're going to say, exclude, IP address.

00:01:37.275 --> 00:01:41.990
This filter pattern is interpreted as a regular expression.

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:46.789
So, we need to generate one regular expression that corresponds to the range.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.420
To do this, we're going to use a utility called

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.490
regexip that actually I developed myself for this purpose specifically.

00:01:55.489 --> 00:02:05.544
So, let's say that your IP address range is 231.88.156,

00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:11.219
1 to 15, generate regular expression.

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:18.199
Here we have our single regex that will only match the IP addresses within the range.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:25.219
We can copy that, paste that into the filter pattern, and save the filter.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.689
Let's consider how we are going to apply this filter to our main view.

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.539
At this point, it's only in the test view.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:36.229
We don't want to apply the filter to the main view immediately.

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:41.419
We apply it to the test view first to give Google Analytics a little time to process

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.239
the filter in the test view and for us to

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.645
make sure that the filter is essentially not breaking anything.

00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:51.740
So, once you've applied the filter in your test view,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.405
wait a little time,

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:54.919
at least a few days,

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:59.164
maybe 7-10 days and make sure that everything looks okay.

00:02:59.164 --> 00:03:02.824
Then, you can copy the same filter to your main view.

00:03:02.824 --> 00:03:05.269
We don't have to recreate the filter.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.955
To copy the filter to our main view,

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:10.865
first, we'll select main view.

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:14.284
Notice there are no filters in the main view yet.

00:03:14.284 --> 00:03:16.819
We'll click Add Filter.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.954
Now instead of create new filter,

00:03:19.955 --> 00:03:23.275
we'll select Apply existing Filter,

00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:26.950
select Exclude Internal IP Addresses.

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.199
This production server only filter could have been

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.319
applied anywhere else within the account.

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.704
We have access to that filter as well.

00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:39.950
But for now we're just moving over exclude internal IP addresses.

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.919
Now, the same filter is applied in our main view.

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:47.394
Just to reiterate, never apply a filter directly to your main view.

00:03:47.395 --> 00:03:52.040
Always apply and evaluate a filter first in your test few.

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:54.139
Mistakes happen with filters,

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.750
so make sure to follow this best practice.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.610
It's critically important.
