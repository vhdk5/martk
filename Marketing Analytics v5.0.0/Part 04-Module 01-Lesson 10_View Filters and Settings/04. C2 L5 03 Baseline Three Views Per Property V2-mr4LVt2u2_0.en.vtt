00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.535
When we first create a Google Analytics account or just a new property,

00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:07.515
each property has a single default view.

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:10.649
The view is named all website data.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.080
But if the data is coming in at

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.649
the property level as we've seen in our previous discussions,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.169
why do we need multiple views?

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.750
Having multiple views allows us to create

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.524
different end transformations of the data that comes in raw at the property level.

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:32.104
For one thing, views allow us to do important housekeeping

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:37.204
like excluding our internal traffic and consolidating URLs.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:43.564
We can configure additional metrics and populate reports such as goals and site search.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:47.224
View filtering allows us to create subsets of our data.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.600
You can create more than three views per property,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.550
but as a baseline best-practice,

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.359
we always want to have at least three views per property.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.185
We want to make sure to have an unfiltered backup,

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.330
one or more test views,

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.465
and a working view.

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:07.484
Usually, we have a main working view,

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:11.855
but we can have additional subsetted working views as well.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:13.939
But as a baseline,

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.149
one unfiltered view, at least one test view,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.280
and one or more views where we're actually doing our analysis,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.364
and of those, one view should be specified as your main view.

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:29.765
If we go back to the org test account,

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:31.924
we remember that we did create

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:36.810
a test view when we were configuring a goal in an earlier lesson.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.254
But let's build out the rest of our baseline three views at this point.

00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:44.509
Back in the default All Web Site Data view,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.995
we're going to change the name.

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:48.140
As a preference, I don't like to go into

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.409
Google Analytics and see all website data as a view name.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.295
The view looks somewhat neglected to me when I see that.

00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:58.049
All we have to do is go to view settings,

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.620
and we can call this 01 Main, 01 working,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.930
anything that designates it as your main view where you'll do most of your analysis,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.310
and I like to use numbers to always keep the views organized.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.485
If we go back to the top level of the admin screen and we refresh,

00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:21.650
we see that our main view in fact has been renamed.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.425
So, now, we have our main view, our test view.

00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:28.955
Let's create our backup view.

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:31.250
This is a good name for our backup view.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.169
We could call it any of these names.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.484
Raw, unfiltered, do not touch, backup.

00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:39.980
The idea is that we're going to collect the raw data

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.250
coming in from the property and we're not going to apply any filters,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.139
any settings, no transformations.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:51.754
So, if for any reason there's ever a problem with a filter or a setting on a view,

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:55.759
we'll have the raw feed from the property still accessible to us.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.694
Now, if you haven't created a backup view until now, that's probably okay.

00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:02.629
The backup is not retroactive,

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.210
but if you've gotten this far without any major problems in your view,

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.615
then all you need is to make sure now forward that you do have the backup,

00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:16.280
again, in case there's a problem with a view setting or view filter.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.134
Now, we have our baseline best-practice three views,

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:23.909
main, test, and unfiltered.

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.250
In the rest of this lesson,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.479
we will be spending most of our time in the test view trying

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:35.699
out view filters and view settings before we apply them to the main view.
