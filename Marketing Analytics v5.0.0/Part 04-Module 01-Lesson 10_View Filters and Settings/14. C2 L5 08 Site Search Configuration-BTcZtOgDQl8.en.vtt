00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
Our view settings allow us to configure Site Search tracking.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.759
In the merchandise store test account,

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.535
we can access the search terms report,

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:13.964
behaviour, site search, search terms.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:17.910
The search terms report is unique in Google Analytics in

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.800
that it shows us specifically what users are searching for,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.839
what they're inputting on their own.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.100
So, it's a unique opportunity to understand what our visitors are seeking.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.370
Now, the search terms report won't be populated by default,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.579
but in most cases it is an easy view

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.144
setting that allows us to configure the search terms report.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:42.920
The first thing that we want to do is to go to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.355
the website that we're tracking and perform a search.

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:48.544
So, if we search for a hat,

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:53.064
we see in this case that we actually have the search term appearing twice.

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:55.879
Key equals hat and keyword equals hat.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.734
So, we have two query parameters to choose from.

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:02.314
If we searched for a shirt,

00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:06.439
here we also see key equals shirt keyword equal shirt.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.164
Let's look at another example.

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:12.590
If we're on eBay and we search for solar panel,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.850
we have ampersand underscore NKW, equals solar panel.

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:22.489
So, in this case underscore NKW would be the key that

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:26.030
we would use to identify the search parameter in the URL.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.799
What we would need to do to configure

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.980
the search reports would be to go into the view settings,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.620
again first in our test view,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.430
turn on site search tracking and here's where we add the query parameter.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.520
In the case of the Google merchandise store,

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:43.939
we saw that we could use key or keyword.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.579
It's a little bit unusual to have the search term appearing twice in the results URL,

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.510
but in the case of the merchandise store we could use either and the case

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.945
of eBay we would use underscore NKW.

00:01:57.944 --> 00:02:00.875
Whatever the query parameter is in the URL,

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:03.334
that indicates the search string,

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:07.579
that's what we use to configure site search in Google Analytics and we could

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.930
also check this box for stripping the query perimeters out of the URL so

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.439
we don't have to strip the query parameters out as we did in

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:21.245
the previous section focusing on the URL query parameter consolidation.

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.189
If we have site search categories,

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.770
we could populate those as well,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.885
those are less common.

00:02:26.884 --> 00:02:30.289
Let's consider another case where the search term does not appear in

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:34.039
the results page URL and the name equals value pair format,

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.429
but just incorporated right into the path of the URL.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.870
In this case, we couldn't use the view setting to configure site search.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.909
Again, we would need to use a filter and a regular expression.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.944
We would specifically use an advanced filter with a matching group.

00:02:50.944 --> 00:02:53.599
We would extract that matching group and output

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.419
it from the request URL to the search term.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.500
So, this scenario where the search term doesn't appear as

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.354
name equals value is just a little bit more of a challenge to configure,

00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:06.544
but still completely doable.

00:03:06.544 --> 00:03:09.559
Once the site search reports are populated,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.485
there are just a few things that we'll want to consider.

00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:18.245
We can add start pages a secondary dimension to see on which page the search originated.

00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:23.300
Don't be surprised to see entrances as a start page because search results pages

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.685
can be linked to directly and sometimes they can even be indexed in search engines.

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:34.909
If we add start page as a secondary dimension we will see in fact that in

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.329
many cases a search results page was accessed

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.325
directly either through a link or through indexing in a search engine.

00:03:43.324 --> 00:03:46.969
Another thing that we'll want to consider with site searches is just to

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:51.305
verify in fact that there are multiple users who are performing the searches.

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:54.849
If we see a great number of searches for a specific term,

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.539
sometimes that can originate from one person or a small number of people.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:04.340
We can quickly verify that the searches are being performed by different people by

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.275
adding a pretty granular secondary dimension something like city or browser version.

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:11.385
I'm going to go ahead and add city,

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:17.000
and we do see in fact that the search terms are quite broken up over different cities.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.040
So, we could be reasonably sure that there

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.470
are different people performing these searches.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.030
We can add search destination page as a secondary dimension to see where visitors are

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:30.824
going after performing a search or if an exit occurred,

00:04:30.824 --> 00:04:35.459
in which case the search results pages themselves may need some optimization.
