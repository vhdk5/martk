00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
Some of the view settings and filters that we discussed in this lesson

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.414
may remind you of the custom segments that we built in the last lesson.

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:12.029
In fact, view settings and filters on the one hand and

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.974
custom segments on the other are quite similar in some cases,

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:19.109
but let's make sure we understand what makes them different.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.925
Let's say that we wanted to see a subset of sessions that originated from Canada.

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.859
We could do this in two ways.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.824
We could create a custom segment or we could create a dedicated filtered view.

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:35.000
If we create a segment of visitors from Canada versus a filtered view,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.075
we want to remember that the custom segment is retroactive.

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:44.090
By default, the custom segment is visible only to the creator of the segment.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.720
You only need to read and analyze access to create a segment,

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.909
it's not an edit activity.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.099
Importantly, a segment does not alter the underlying view data,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.240
which is why we never have to hesitate to experiment with segments.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.135
View filters and view settings on the other hand,

00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:04.164
we have to be more careful with.

00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:07.250
View settings and filters apply from the moment they

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.265
are configured going forward, not retroactively.

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:13.519
They're seen by anyone who accesses the view,

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:18.439
which is why we don't want to experiment too much with view filters and view settings.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.289
We want to have a good idea of what we're doing

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.115
before we change filtering and change settings in a view.

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:30.905
You need edit level access to the view to change a setting or to apply a filter.

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:33.799
Importantly, any view setting or

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.954
any view filter that you change will alter the underlying view data,

00:01:37.954 --> 00:01:41.614
which is why these activities do require edit access,

00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:46.024
and which is why we want to be more careful about view settings and view filters,

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:48.650
then we do for custom segments.
