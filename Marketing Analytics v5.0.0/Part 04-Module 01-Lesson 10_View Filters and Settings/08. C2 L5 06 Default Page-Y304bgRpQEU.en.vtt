00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.988
Continuing with the idea of cleaning up our dimension values,

00:00:03.988 --> 00:00:07.154
we're going to take a look at the Default page setting.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:09.660
The Default page setting will basically work like

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.445
a rewrite filter but it surfaced as a view setting instead of a filter.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:19.829
We're going to use it primarily to rewrite that forward slash that shows up by default

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:25.125
in most of our Google Analytics views to a more meaningful value for the homepage.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:30.704
In some cases the setting will be used to consolidate two variations of the homepage URL.

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:33.449
If we going into the Google Analytics demo account,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.255
we'll see a homepage that has a meaningful name.

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:38.175
This is what we want.

00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:42.169
This, however, does not occur by default on Google Analytics.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.414
This is generated from a setting,

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:46.359
the Default page setting.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.219
Usually, when we go into Google Analytics,

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.839
what we see as a top page or one of the top pages is just the forward slash.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.470
That corresponds to the homepage but it's not ideal for

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.019
our own reporting and it's certainly not ideal when we're communicating with others.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.875
So, how did we rewrite this forward slash to a more meaningful value.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.784
This is where the Default page setting comes in.

00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:13.924
We're back in the Test View in our Org Test account.

00:01:13.924 --> 00:01:16.299
If we click into View Settings,

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.994
we see the Default page setting.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:23.615
This is where we can specify how we want the forward slash to be rewritten.

00:01:23.614 --> 00:01:27.079
If we want to rewrite the forward slash as

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.560
forward slash home all we have to enter is home,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.195
without the forward slash.

00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:36.109
There are some additional considerations to the Default page though.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.474
One consideration is, if your homepage appears two different ways.

00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:45.079
If you're not rewriting the Default page on the server to just the domain name,

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.560
your homepage may appear in Google Analytics as both

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.140
forward slash and something like index.php or default.aspx.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.400
In that case, we're not just using the Default page value to rewrite

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.740
the forward slash but we're rewriting

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:04.879
the forward slash to match the other variation of the homepage that appears.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:07.039
So, in this case,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.560
where we have forward slash forward and slash index.php referring to the same page,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.430
we'll want to use index.php for the Default page.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.469
So, instead of home,

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.784
the Default page is determined for us.

00:02:22.784 --> 00:02:24.314
Once we did that,

00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:29.794
the forward slash and index.php would be rolled up into a single value.

00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:34.039
Now, there is a significant caveat to the Default page.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.189
The value that we specify for our Default page is

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.930
added to all page dimensions that end with forward slash,

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.640
not just forward slash on its own.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.849
If we had a page dimensions such as services

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.189
forward slash and we added home as the Default page,

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:56.254
services forward slash would be rewritten to services forward slash home.

00:02:56.254 --> 00:03:01.400
If we want it to just rewrite the stand alone forward slash to forward slash home,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.635
we would need to use a view filter,

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:07.504
and again, we would take advantage of regular expressions.

00:03:07.504 --> 00:03:11.644
Under Filters we could click New Filter.

00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:20.545
Call this filter Rewrite forward slash to forward slash home,

00:03:20.544 --> 00:03:24.405
Custom, Search and Replace,

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:27.780
Filter Field, Request URI.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.974
We're going to start with the forward slash

00:03:30.974 --> 00:03:34.159
and we're going to use Regex to say I don't want

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:40.669
to match anything that has any characters before the forward slash,

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.454
so beginning of string anchor,

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:45.340
and nothing after the forward slash,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.890
end of string anchors.

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.219
So, we're only matching the forward slash.

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:56.734
Now, we could specify forward slash home as the Replace String and save the filter,

00:03:56.735 --> 00:03:58.420
check it out in the Test View,

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.284
apply it to the Main View of it's looking good in the test after a little while.

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:06.590
Let's consider another challenge that we sometimes have with the page dimension.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.159
Let's say that we have the same pages appearing sometimes

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.835
without a forward slash and sometimes with a forward slash.

00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:17.329
How would we consolidate these so they look like this?

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.125
In this case, we're going to use an advanced filter for extraction

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:25.370
and rewrite and we'll take advantage of regular expressions again.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.845
Click into Filters, Add Filter,

00:04:30.845 --> 00:04:36.200
call this filter Strip

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:42.899
from end of Page, Custom.

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:47.099
Again, we're going to do an advanced filter,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.210
so we can extract and output.

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:53.729
We're going to start with

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.045
Request URI and we know we're

00:04:57.045 --> 00:05:00.405
trying to match the page dimensions that end with a forward slash,

00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:04.004
so forward slash end of string anchor.

00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:11.074
We want to match and pull in anything that precedes the final forward slash.

00:05:11.074 --> 00:05:13.295
So, we're going to start with a dot,

00:05:13.295 --> 00:05:17.390
meaning any single character and regular expression notation.

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.745
We're going to use the plus sign quantifier,

00:05:20.745 --> 00:05:24.550
which means match one or more of the proceeding character,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.444
which in this case is any character.

00:05:27.444 --> 00:05:32.404
Finally, we're going to wrap that plus sign.

00:05:32.404 --> 00:05:36.250
So, it becomes a grouping that we can extract.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.415
We're going to say Output To,

00:05:39.415 --> 00:05:44.080
Request URI and the advanced filter notation for pulling

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:49.589
in a matching group from Field A or Field B,

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:55.859
which in this case does not mean end of string anchor, dollar sign A1.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.205
This means pull in the first matching group from Field A.

00:06:00.204 --> 00:06:04.579
So, this is a little bit involved but you see how regular expressions allow us to

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:08.919
cleanly solve the problem and get all of our URLs consolidated.
