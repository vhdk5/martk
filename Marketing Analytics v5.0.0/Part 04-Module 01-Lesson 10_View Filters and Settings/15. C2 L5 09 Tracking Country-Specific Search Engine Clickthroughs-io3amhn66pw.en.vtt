00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.919
Let's consider a special case of identifying country-specific search sources.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:07.259
What we mean is that by default,

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.039
a click-through from a search engine with a top-level domain other than the

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:16.439
default.com would appear with just the search engine as the traffic source.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.865
So, for instance, google.co.uk would appear as just Google as a traffic source.

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:26.879
What we have to do in this case is actually add

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.969
organic search sources at the property level.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.914
This is actually not controlled through a view setting or a view filter.

00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:35.769
It's a property setting.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.030
But we are including it in this lesson because it does

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.995
relate to transforming the data that's coming in at the property level.

00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:45.934
If we go into property tracking info,

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:50.320
organic search sources, we could click add search engine.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.740
So, here, we'll say Google UK as an example.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.804
Domain name contains query parameter for the search term in the URL is q.

00:01:01.804 --> 00:01:05.599
We could check that out on google.co.uk directly,

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:07.954
and there we have our rewrite rule.

00:01:07.954 --> 00:01:09.439
So, we could do this for

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.814
every top-level country domain for a search engine that we want to preserve.

00:01:14.814 --> 00:01:17.539
If we go into the source medium report,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.960
we would see these country-specific search engine is broken out.
