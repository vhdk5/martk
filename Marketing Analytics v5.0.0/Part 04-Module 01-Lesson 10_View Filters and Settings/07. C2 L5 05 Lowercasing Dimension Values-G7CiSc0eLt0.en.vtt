As additional basic housekeeping for our Google Analytics data capture,

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:07.950
we want to lowercase several dimension values.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.140
Why do we want to do this?

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.429
Well, as a basic principle of Google Analytics data quality,

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.449
you want to make sure that there aren't multiple fragment

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.849
to dimension values that refer to the same thing.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.530
We see in this case,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.195
in the page dimension,

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:29.785
that we have stored the smallest and the biggest referring to the same page.

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:33.515
That could potentially happen if you have different internal links or

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:37.730
even external links that are accessing the page with different case variations,

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:41.034
and they are not being reconciled on the server.

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:46.084
As a note, this is marked up from the Google merchandise store.

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:50.615
There aren't actually case variations in the Google merchandise store account,

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:52.280
so you won't find them there.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.340
Here's another example that crops up fairly frequently,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.245
case variations and medium values.

00:00:58.244 --> 00:01:02.589
Here we see email with a small E and a big E,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.040
that can occur very easily if case variations are included in campaign parameters,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.525
which we'll be talking about more in an upcoming lesson.

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:15.815
The overall idea is to fight dimension fragmentation.

00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:20.314
We don't want multiple dimension values referring to the same thing.

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:24.349
That just makes our work as analysts much harder,

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:29.134
and forces us to focus on things other than analysis and insight.

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:33.335
We can apply simple lowercase filters for the following dimensions,

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:36.709
these are considered good dimensions to lowercase.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.479
We can start with Request URI,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.265
which means exactly the same thing as the page dimension.

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:45.635
But when we're defining filters,

00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:48.880
page appears as Request URI.

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:51.884
We'll want to lowercase campaign medium,

00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:57.135
campaign source, campaign name, and campaign content.

00:01:57.135 --> 00:02:00.094
If you're using that campaign parameter as well.

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:03.049
Even though our event dimensions should be very

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.319
consistent if we're using Google Tag Manager correctly.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.969
As a best practice,

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.900
we can still lowercase event category, event action,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.200
and event label, and we'll also want to lowercase

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:19.539
search term which we'll talk about more later in this lesson.
