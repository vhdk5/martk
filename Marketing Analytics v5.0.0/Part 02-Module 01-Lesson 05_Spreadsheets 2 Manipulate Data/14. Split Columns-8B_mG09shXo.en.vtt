00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
Another common data cleaning operation,

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.015
is splitting data, that's combined in one cell.

00:00:06.014 --> 00:00:10.169
For example, suppose we have first and last names in the cells but are

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:15.474
going to want to sort or filter by just the first or just the last name later.

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:18.660
In that case, we're going to need a column for each.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.234
So, it would be nice to have a first and last names split into two separate columns.

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:27.949
We can do this with the text to columns tool.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.484
Before you start, think about how many columns you're going to end up with.

00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:35.719
In this case, it's one column turning into two.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.710
So, insert a blank column to make room.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.015
Select your data set range.

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:44.405
It's okay to select whole columns.

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:49.230
Go to the Data menu and find, text to columns.

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.162
Once again, you'll have some choices to make in the dialog that opens.

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:55.229
Delimited means that the text you want to

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.379
separate has some character where the split should be.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.420
After clicking next, choose which delimiter to split on.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.320
We'll check the comma because our data is separated with commas.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.905
Clicking next, there are some more advanced options but for our purposes,

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:13.349
we can just click Finish.
