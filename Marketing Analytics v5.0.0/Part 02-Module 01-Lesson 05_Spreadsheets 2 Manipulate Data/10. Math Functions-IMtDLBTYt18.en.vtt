00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
When we think of spreadsheets,

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:05.160
we probably think of math operations first.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.414
So it's pretty easy to imagine some applications for them,

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:10.994
perhaps adding lists of money or items,

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:14.459
determining average prices or maybe multiplying unit

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.914
cost times the number of units as we did with the fruit stand example.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:23.085
There are two kinds of arithmetic operations in spreadsheets,

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:27.510
those done with arithmetic operators and those that use functions.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.364
Arithmetic operators include addition, subtraction,

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:34.920
multiplication and division using simple plus,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.135
minus, asterisk and slash symbols in the formula.

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:42.689
Pretty much as you would actually write these out,

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:44.750
as with all spreadsheet formulas,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.469
these formulas always begin with an equal sign.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.739
The second type of math operation uses functions.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.675
A couple of very useful statistical functions are sum and average.

00:00:57.674 --> 00:01:03.234
Here I'm using sum to add up a range of numbers in the fruit stand example.

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:09.340
Previously, we did this with arithmetic operators adding each individual cell.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.424
It's much easier to just identify a range to sum.

00:01:13.424 --> 00:01:15.780
Average works the same way,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.420
just select the range to get the average of it.
