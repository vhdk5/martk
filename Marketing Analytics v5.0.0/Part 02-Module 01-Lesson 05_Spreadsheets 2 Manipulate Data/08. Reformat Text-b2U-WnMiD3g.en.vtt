00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.400
In addition to extracting text,

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.380
there are some useful functions for changing how your text is displayed.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.690
One of these is concatenate.

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:17.214
Concatenate gives us a way to combine a list of text items from multiple cells easily.

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:21.204
Let's see how that looks with some very simple examples.

00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:25.659
In this example, I have some tabular information: first name,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.754
last name and location.

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:32.579
I can use concatenate to create sentences with this information.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.554
The first name, then a space,

00:00:34.554 --> 00:00:36.979
the last name, then a phrase,

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.144
lives in, with spaces,

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:43.265
then the location and a period.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:47.649
Fill it down and I have my sentences.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.810
They look a little funny though,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.175
I think there may have been some spaces I didn't see in the data.

00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:54.445
That happens a lot,

00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:57.645
which is why the trim function is so helpful.

00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:00.775
I can just put it right at the front of my other function,

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:04.200
with a closing parenthesis on the end, fill it down.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.564
There, that fixed it.

00:01:06.564 --> 00:01:10.584
A few more easy functions that can clean up data.

00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:15.703
To ensure that names and places are properly capitalized,

00:01:15.703 --> 00:01:18.119
the proper function works great.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.520
Upper makes all letters upper case,

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:24.510
and lower does the opposite,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.769
makes all letters lowercase.
