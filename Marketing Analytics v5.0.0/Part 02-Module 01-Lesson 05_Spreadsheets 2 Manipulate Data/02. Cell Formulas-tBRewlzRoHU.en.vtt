00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.525
It is common when working with spreadsheets,

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:07.600
to create a single cell formula and then

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.224
duplicate it with a fill to create a column or row.

00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:14.314
So, it's important to get that first formula right.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.230
A cell formula is an expression that defines

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.060
the operations for calculating the value of a cell.

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:26.000
It might be a constant or contain mathematical operators or functions,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.750
and it can reference a single cell,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.320
a range of cells or none at all.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.835
A cell formula begins with an equal sign.

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:41.365
This cell is now equal to whatever I type to the right of the equal sign,

00:00:41.365 --> 00:00:43.310
that can be a number.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.375
It could be a math operation like addition or multiplication of two constants.

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:51.465
It could be a reference to some other cell.

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:54.340
If the original cell is referenced with a formula,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.090
then a change to the original cell will automatically change the one that references it.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.550
Besides constants and references,

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.670
functions can be included in formulas and that's where the true power lies.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.840
A function is a builtin routine that calculates a value from inputs provided.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.090
Functions always start with some key words such as sum or average or trim and so on,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.900
followed by a set of parentheses with parameters in between.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.170
A parameter might be a constant or a cell reference or range

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.659
reference or other expression that is required for the function calculation.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.269
It's even possible to nest functions.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:45.239
They can become quite complex.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:48.839
You have to look at the function definition to know what kind of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.939
parameters are expected and how they will be used by the function.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.454
A function allows us to use data we already have in a new way.

00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:01.094
There are many types,

00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:06.944
and you can take a closer look at them in the function library on the formula menus tab.

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:11.060
You'll learn some useful ones in these introductory lessons.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.080
There are over 400 though,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.590
so keep in mind that there are more to explore.
