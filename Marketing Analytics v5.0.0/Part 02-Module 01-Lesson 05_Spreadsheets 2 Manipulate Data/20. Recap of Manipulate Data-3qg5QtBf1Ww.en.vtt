00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.774
Great job.

00:00:01.774 --> 00:00:05.490
You've learned some key spreadsheet skills for manipulating data.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.734
You've learned how to create cell formulas using text and math functions.

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:13.455
You've learned to perform some key data operations in spreadsheets.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:18.960
You know how to clean data by eliminating duplicate rows and how to split columns.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.600
Finally, you've learned how to sort data and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.359
the basics of using the powerful filter operation.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.494
Now that you have control of that data,

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:31.289
it's time to do more to analyze your data.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.810
In fact, you already started doing that in

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.579
the last exercise when you started answering questions about your data set.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.479
More functions and tools are coming up next.
