00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.485
Text functions modify or provide information about text strings that we find in data.

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:10.890
A text string is a series of characters such as letters,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.570
numbers, and punctuation that is not treated like a number.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.875
Examples of text or text strings are; names,

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:26.274
phrases, cities, countries, not a date or a number.

00:00:26.274 --> 00:00:29.739
There are many text functions in spreadsheets.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.975
We're going to go through a useful subset of these starting with the Substitute Function.

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:40.020
This is different from the find and replace tools we looked at in the previous lesson.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.070
Those were used to make fundamental changes to values that exist in cells.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.100
In that case, the original information was destroyed and replaced.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.590
When using a substitute function,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.365
the original data remains intact.

00:00:55.365 --> 00:01:00.125
It's just transformed in a new location that we create.

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:03.174
Let's take a closer look at how to do this.

00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:04.304
I have a string,

00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:05.755
the quick brown fox,

00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:08.844
and I want to replace brown with red.

00:01:08.844 --> 00:01:13.489
There are a couple of ways that you can enter a formula in Excel and I'll go over both.

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:15.434
One way is to use the formula bar.

00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:19.760
Select your cell, then click the fx button on the formula bar.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.765
You notice that it automatically enters the equal sign to get you started.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:27.799
A dialog will appear with the menu of functions and a search box.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.060
Select the function you want and click okay.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.685
Another dialog will appear with boxes for entering the function parameters.

00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:38.400
There's also some helpful information.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.377
For the substitute function,

00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:43.114
the first parameter box is for the text,

00:01:43.114 --> 00:01:45.449
which means the text we're searching on.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.719
The sentence in A1 for this example.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.989
You can type A1 or select the cell directly.

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:55.125
The next box is for the old text which is brown,

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:59.045
and then a box for the new text which is red.

00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:02.174
Finally, there is a box for the instance number,

00:02:02.174 --> 00:02:03.959
which is an optional parameter.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.912
I'll leave this blank to indicate I want all occurrences to be substituted.

00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:16.645
And we see that my new result is a sentence where brown has been replaced with red.

00:02:16.645 --> 00:02:22.365
Notice that this dialog also automatically put my old and new values in quotes.

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:26.490
The second way to do this is more direct and a little faster.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.210
Select the cell you want and just start typing the formula,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.375
starting with the equal sign.

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:36.430
A list appears trying to autocomplete what you've typed.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.045
Click tab to select the highlighted function.

00:02:40.044 --> 00:02:43.664
Now we see a helpful prompt showing function parameters

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:48.329
with the first parameter highlighted and optional parameters shown in brackets.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.415
Click the cell for the first parameter then

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:53.759
type the comma to move onto the next parameter.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.530
Notice that you need to type the double quotes

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.729
yourself for the text values with this method.

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.840
Just close the print seize and click enter,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.780
and you've entered all the required parameters.
