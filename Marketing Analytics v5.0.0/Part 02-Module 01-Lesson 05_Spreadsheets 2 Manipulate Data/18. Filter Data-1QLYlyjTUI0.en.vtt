00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
Filtering data is a way to group data by selecting

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:07.665
characteristics from our data columns and not looking at the other data.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:09.720
Looking at a list of names,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.769
suppose we want to find every one with the first name Luis.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.600
We could sort on the first name and scroll down and find everyone named Luis.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.890
But this changes the data and maybe we don't want to do that.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.484
It seems like there's a better way and there is using filters.

00:00:27.484 --> 00:00:30.344
Select your data. On the Data menu,

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:31.754
click the filter icon,

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:33.314
which looks like a funnel.

00:00:33.314 --> 00:00:34.949
When the filter is on,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.075
we see little filter boxes with pull down arrows at the top of each column.

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:42.255
This is where you choose filters.

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:45.810
Click the filter box on the first name.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.804
There's a dialog. There are some choices for sorting which we don't want right now.

00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:54.284
And there's a list of check boxes for every value found in the column.

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:56.279
To look at only at the Luis names,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.090
de-select all the boxes and select only the Luis box.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.350
Or you can search for it and click okay.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.070
We now see only the matches.

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:11.474
At this point, we could add additional filters or copy our subset to somewhere else.

00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:14.714
To return your view to the full original data set,

00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:17.670
click on the clear icon or just turn filtering off

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.939
altogether by clicking on the filter funnel again.
