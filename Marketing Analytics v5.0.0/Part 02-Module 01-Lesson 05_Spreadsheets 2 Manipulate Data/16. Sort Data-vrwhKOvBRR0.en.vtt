00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
Now that the first and last names are separated,

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.714
let's try sorting the list by first name.

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:07.070
Select all the data.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.005
It's easiest to select whole columns but not required.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.295
The sort functions are in the Data menu.

00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:14.230
There's a little A to Z icon.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.894
By default, the sort will be on the first column.

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:21.600
Well, this didn't work very well in our case because we want to sort

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.020
by first name which happens to be in the second column. Let's try again.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.585
Choose the sort option and then there's a dialog to specify columns and other details.

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:34.969
Here we can choose to sort by the first name column, A to Z.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.129
But wait, I have a couple of first names

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.885
that are the same yet the last name is out of order.

00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:44.570
Let's go back to that dialog again.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.289
We need to add a level.

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.549
Now, we'll sort by first name then last and now,

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:54.269
both are in the right order.
