00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.309
In this lesson, you'll learn to manipulate data in your spreadsheet.

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:07.424
You already know how to paste data into your spreadsheet,

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.125
and delete and insert rows and columns.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.435
But in this lesson, we'll go farther.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:15.615
We'll start at the cell level with cell formulas.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.990
A typical use case in working with spreadsheets is to put

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:23.820
together a formula in a cell and then duplicated in more rows.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.745
It all starts with getting the first cell formula right,

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:29.464
and you're going to learn how to do that.

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:31.980
You'll learn to manipulate text data with functions and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.859
combine and split text in various ways.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.630
Then, you'll learn to manipulate

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.094
numerical data using basic math and statistical functions.

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:43.004
After working at the cell level,

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.495
we'll move on to table level data manipulations.

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:51.209
You'll learn how to remove duplicate rows and how to split columns.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.134
These procedures are useful for cleaning your data.

00:00:55.134 --> 00:00:58.159
You'll learn how to sort and filter your data.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.819
The filtering tools have a number of powerful information features built in.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.780
So, we'll take time to explore these features.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.150
As always, be sure to do the quizzes and exercises in your own spreadsheet application,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.245
because this is how you will best retain what's presented,

00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:19.000
by doing it yourself. Here we go.
