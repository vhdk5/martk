00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.290
Table level data operations are useful for cleaning and manipulating lists of data.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.019
Suppose you import some data that has a lot of good information,

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.214
but is not what we call clean data.

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:14.910
When we clean our data,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.769
we're trying to rid it of corrupt and inaccurate data items.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.634
For example, in this little data set,

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:25.770
I see some duplicate rows and there are

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.410
some text anomalies that might throw off my ability to group things later.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.549
We've already learned that some text and formatting functions can be used to help

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:40.364
clean individual cells such as how to fix this name,

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:44.440
which seems to have its capitalization completely backwards.

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:50.195
However, those cell level functions won't help us delete duplicate rows.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:54.490
There is a particular Excel operation for that.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.370
Select your data set range.

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:58.739
Go to the Data menu and find the icon that looks

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.600
like two columns with an arrow in between.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.875
You have some choices to make in the dialog that opens.

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:07.680
If you select My data has headers,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.685
the operation will ignore the top row of your selection.

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:13.180
If you only want to look for duplicates in certain columns, choose those columns.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.005
In this example, I'm looking for duplications that are exact matches in both columns.

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:23.209
Click okay and the duplicate row is removed.
