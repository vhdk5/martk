00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's suppose we have a list of phrases and we want to

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.095
extract the first word from each. How would we do that?

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:10.369
Thinking this through, for the starting word,

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:16.379
we want to extract everything from the left up until the first space character.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.765
To do that, we need two functions: Find and Left.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:27.449
I've exposed the formulas so that we can see what's happening more clearly.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.004
The find function searches the phrase string for whatever sub-string we give it,

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:34.664
in this case, a space,

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:38.935
and returns the character position where that sub-string was found.

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:40.335
So, for Hello world,

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:44.899
the first space is at character number six in the string.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.420
The left function extracts the number of characters we tell it to starting from the left.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.910
For Hello world, we're telling the function to extract one less than

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:03.449
the first space count that find determined were five characters on the left.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.655
This results in the final text of,

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:09.670
Hello, which is five characters long.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.364
This could have been done in one step, instead of two,

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:17.711
by nesting the find function inside the left function.

00:01:17.712 --> 00:01:19.064
Once we do this,

00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:23.060
our equation is only dependent on the original data.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.019
Now the other steps don't matter.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:28.814
We can delete those intermediate columns.

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:32.950
The right function works in a similar way except

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.909
that right selects a number of characters from the right.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.859
In this case, the last three letters of World which are RLD.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:50.310
Mid extracts from anywhere in a phrase based on some starting point,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.545
in this case, starting with the second letter,

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:58.540
there are three letters extracted, ELL.
