00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
What if we want to know whether there are more apples than any other fruits in the list?

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.699
In that case, our sentence in English would be something like,

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:13.049
if there are more apples than oranges in the order,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.859
AND there are more apples than pairs in the order, print 'Apples Rule!'

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.605
AND is another logical function in Excel,

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:27.060
which is only true if all of its conditions are true.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:32.144
Notice that AND like IF is a function not an operator.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:36.359
It has to be entered with its keyword AND followed by

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:41.204
parentheses with its parameters which are conditional statements.

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:44.894
To use the AND function in an IF statement,

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:48.405
we will have to nest it inside the IF function.

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:54.695
The entire AND function is now the conditional part of the IF function.

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:58.890
Recapping. The result from the AND function is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.870
true if all its conditions are true, and false otherwise.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.920
The OR function works much the same way except that it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.519
evaluates as true if any of its parameters are true.

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:14.144
And one more for you,

00:01:14.144 --> 00:01:17.625
the NOT function simply reverses the logic.

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:22.359
It changes true to false and false to true.

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:23.954
That may seem complicated,

00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:26.219
but you'll get better at it with practice.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.000
Speaking of which, it's your turn to try some combinations.
