00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
Congratulations on completing the analyze data lesson.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.144
By now, you've learned a number of manipulation techniques and formulas,

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:10.830
but more importantly, you've learned how to use

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.699
those skills to answer questions about data you're given.

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.009
That's what analysis is all about,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.804
asking and answering questions based on data.

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:24.300
In particular, you've learned how to aggregate data with

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.609
statistical functions and to test data with conditional if statements.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.969
You've learned how to create pivot tables and use named ranges

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.320
and lookups to find answers to your questions efficiently.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.884
If you've done all the quizzes and exercises,

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:41.714
and I hope you have,

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:47.335
you've practised these skills including combining some of them to answer data questions.

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:51.960
So far, we've just answered questions with numbers or text.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.195
But some answers are clear if we can see the data in a chart or graph.

00:00:57.195 --> 00:01:01.000
That's coming up next in the visualized data lesson.
