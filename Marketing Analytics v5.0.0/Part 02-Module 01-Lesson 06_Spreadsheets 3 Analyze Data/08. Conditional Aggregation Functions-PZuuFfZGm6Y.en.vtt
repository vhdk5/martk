00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.359
Conditional aggregation functions are

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:08.750
statistical functions that combine aggregation with logical conditions.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.730
They operate across a group of data with some logical conditions.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.844
We'll focus on two of these: COUNTIF and SUMIF.

00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:22.695
Let's say, you have a baseball data set and that your analysis question is,

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:25.585
how many pitchers are there on the roster?

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:28.980
We could filter the data by pitcher and count the number of

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.420
lines showing or we could just use a formula.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.189
With COUNTIF, we can get this information with a single function: equal, COUNTIF,

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:43.649
parentheses, then the range we want to count over,

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.179
which is the whole column of positions, then the criterion.

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:52.524
The criterion can be a text string or a number or an expression.

00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:55.504
In this case, we want the text string pitcher.

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:58.950
So, it goes in double quotes because it's text.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.295
And there we have our answer.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:05.655
If we wanted to count the number of salaries greater than 10 million,

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:11.609
we would need an expression with the comparison operator greater than 10 million.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.525
An expression must also be in double quotes.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:18.800
And there we have our answer.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:25.120
SUMIF works similarly but adds values if the criteria is true rather than counting them.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.599
If we changed the last example from COUNTIF to SUMIF,

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:33.890
we get a sum of all the salaries greater than 10 million,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.750
which will be a pretty big number.
