00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Recall that in an earlier lesson,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.890
you learn two ways to add numbers.

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:07.934
With the plus sign and with the sum function.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:09.855
When you use the plus sign,

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:12.910
you have to reference each cell individually.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.121
But, with sum, a whole range can be referenced.

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.495
Sum is an aggregation function,

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:23.400
that's how aggregation functions work.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:28.859
They operate over a whole group of data at once and result in a single value.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.013
The ones we're interested in are statistical in nature.

00:00:33.014 --> 00:00:36.450
Sum, average, max, min,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.365
median, and standard deviation.

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:43.392
For example, here's our fruit stand again,

00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:45.240
with a few new products.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.325
If I want to get a sum of all the fruit,

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:52.140
I can add each row of fruit then add those sums together to get a grand total.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.770
But, I could also have just asked for the sum of the whole range.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.410
What about some other questions like,

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.209
what was the most fruit sold in any order?

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.545
Well, we want the maximum number of the fruit total column,

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:07.170
and that's an aggregation function, max.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.195
Min works in much the same way for finding the smallest number. What about median?

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:16.509
That's different than average it's the middle value,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.755
but it too is an aggregation function.

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:22.964
Finally, with average and standard deviation,

00:01:22.965 --> 00:01:26.270
we can get the spread of order totals over time.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:38.090
There are more aggregation functions

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.250
that you can find when you need them in the Help files.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.045
For now though, I'm going to give you a quick teaser for using charts.

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:47.239
Looking at the sums for all the fruit,

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:48.674
we know which sells the best,

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:53.432
but I could just highlight the information and click, insert chart.

00:01:53.432 --> 00:01:54.439
Selecting the bar chart,

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.924
in this case, to see it visually.

00:01:56.924 --> 00:02:03.259
We'll go into detail in the visualized data lesson on when to use which kind of chart.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.763
But it's easy to see already why visualizing aggregated data is so impactful.

00:02:08.763 --> 00:02:12.000
Okay, time for you to give this a try.
