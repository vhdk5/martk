00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Suppose we have a list of part numbers or

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.270
abbreviations that correspond to prices or descriptions,

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:09.765
we might have the short version in one table

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:13.169
but need to be able to look up more information elsewhere.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.525
That's what Lookup up functions do.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:21.480
They provide a way to use a keyword to look some other information up in a table.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.937
There are both horizontal and vertical lookup functions,

00:00:24.937 --> 00:00:28.365
but we'll focus on just one, VLOOKUP.

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:30.959
I have a list of airport codes.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.125
Suppose I want to know which airport is code MCI.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:38.424
The leftmost column is the key and the second column in this case is the answer.

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:42.279
Scrolling down, I find out MCI is Kansas City.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.200
The function that does this is VLOOKUP.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.715
I use =vlo, the value I'm looking up,

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.085
which is, ATL in this first case,

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:52.700
then the data range.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.880
I'll select the two columns.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.415
Then, the index of the column,

00:00:57.414 --> 00:00:59.399
which is the second.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.105
Now, I'm going to type false and close parentheses.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:06.054
This worked great.

00:01:06.054 --> 00:01:09.900
I'll do it for the second destination as well.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.380
I have the two columns,

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:16.920
and the second column is the answer,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.850
and false. Here we go.

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:23.959
Good. What if the airport code hadn't been in the list?

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:28.444
Let's try that. ZZZ is not in the list.

00:01:28.444 --> 00:01:32.529
We get an error. We get an error because I put false

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.704
in the formula to indicate I only want to find an exact match.

00:01:36.704 --> 00:01:39.370
What if I didn't put false in the formula?

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.215
Excel would return the closest match which for this problem is just wrong.

00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:45.640
A rule of thumb is,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.248
that when looking up information with VLOOKUP,

00:01:48.248 --> 00:01:51.666
enter false in this optional parameter.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:56.750
Finding the wrong airport in this case is worse than getting an error.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.605
Okay, one more thing.

00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:00.924
Instead of using columns as my range,

00:02:00.924 --> 00:02:02.739
which did work just fine,

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:06.204
it's really better practice to use a named range.

00:02:06.204 --> 00:02:09.129
It's more readable and less prone to errors.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.396
I'll just name this one airport_lookup.

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:15.120
And it works the same.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.615
I can even fill without worrying about losing my absolute address.

00:02:21.615 --> 00:02:24.000
Okay, your turn.
