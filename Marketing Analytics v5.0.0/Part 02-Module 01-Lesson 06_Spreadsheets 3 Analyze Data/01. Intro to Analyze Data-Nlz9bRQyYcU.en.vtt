00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
In the previous lesson,

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.379
you learnt some techniques for manipulating data.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:07.469
In this lesson, you'll learn some additional functions and

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.724
techniques useful for analyzing the data in your spreadsheet.

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:15.969
What do we really mean when we say analyze the data?

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.024
Well, we start with a lot of information about something, our data.

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:24.524
Such as how many apples and oranges were ordered in the fruit stand example,

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:28.799
or rosters and salaries in the baseball players example.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.455
This data by itself doesn't mean much

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:35.049
until we start asking and answering questions about it.

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:40.209
For example, how many pieces of fruit on average were in each order,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.155
or what's the average salary for an American League Baseball player in 2003?

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:50.820
We can find out some of this information using aggregation functions.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.875
You've already used two of these,

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:56.424
sum and average to answer some questions.

00:00:56.424 --> 00:00:58.695
So you've already started analyzing data

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:01.914
with aggregation functions in the previous lesson.

00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:06.329
There are quite a few more aggregation functions and you're going to learn some of these.

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.049
These functions may not answer all the questions we have though.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.310
We often want to find out if a cell meets certain conditions.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.375
For example, if a student scored above a certain value on a test give them an A.

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:23.459
For these conditional dependencies,

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:25.799
logical functions are what is needed.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.884
We'll go over the IF function and the comparison operators that go with it.

00:01:30.885 --> 00:01:36.330
Then, examine logical functions And Or, and Not.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.484
The last group of logical functions we'll explore,

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:42.355
combine aggregation with logic.

00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:47.005
We refer to these as conditional aggregation functions.

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:49.729
Next, you'll learn to create pivot tables.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.010
A pivot table is a tool that will allow you to

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.255
summarize and aggregate data all in one step.

00:01:57.254 --> 00:02:01.364
After that, we'll shift directions a bit and introduce named ranges,

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:06.254
which are helpful when we reuse the same ranges over and over in our spreadsheets.

00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:10.514
It's much easier to remember something like, student roster,

00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:19.250
than some cryptic address like sheet3!A1:J943 or some such thing.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.800
Using descriptive names for ranges will also reduce errors and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.300
increase understanding of the formulas as they become more complex.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.768
The named ranges are going to be especially helpful in working with lookup functions,

00:02:32.768 --> 00:02:34.219
at the end of the lesson.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.229
Okay let's get started.
