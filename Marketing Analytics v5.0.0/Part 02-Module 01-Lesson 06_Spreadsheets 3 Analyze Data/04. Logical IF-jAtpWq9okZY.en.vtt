00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.964
Conditional functions and spreadsheets are part of the logical functions group.

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:07.455
We'll start with If.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:10.620
The function If, like other functions,

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.039
starts out with an equal sign, then if,

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.364
then some parameters which are a condition,

00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:19.754
what to do if the condition is true,

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:23.314
and optionally what to do if it's false.

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:25.740
These parameters can be constants or

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.259
cell references or other functions. Here's an example.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.005
A conditional sentence written in English might be something like,

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:40.560
if there were more apples than oranges in the order, print Apples Rule.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.435
The condition is that there are more apples than oranges,

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:46.320
and the value, if true,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.890
is the statement, Apples Rule.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.884
How would we do this in a fruit stand spreadsheet?

00:00:53.884 --> 00:00:56.969
It's a function, so start with equal, if,

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.789
open parentheses, the apples sell,

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.820
now a comparison operator meaning greater than,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.730
then the oranges sell, comma,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.350
and what to print in double quotes: Apples Rule,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.331
close parentheses and fill down.

00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:16.340
Notice that it just says false,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.945
if apples don't rule because I didn't fill in what to do if the value is false.

00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:24.989
I can fix that by changing my statement to include

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:28.814
an output such as Oranges Rock for the false situation.

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:31.560
So my new statement in English would be,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.429
if there are more apples than oranges in the order,

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.555
print Apples Rule, else, print Oranges Rock.

00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:42.293
For this little example,

00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:46.245
I use the greater than sign as a comparison operator.

00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:52.210
Comparison operators are used in logic statements to compare two values.

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.674
In addition to greater than,

00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:57.329
there are operators for less than,

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.105
equal, greater than or equal,

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:03.374
less than or equal, and not equal.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:08.064
They're shown here with an operator symbol in Excel.

00:02:08.064 --> 00:02:14.030
Any of these comparison operators can be used to create a true or false condition,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.340
and that's what the if statement will evaluate following your instructions for each.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.000
It's time for you to give this a try.
