00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
In the first lesson,

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:03.734
when ranges were introduced,

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.750
I mentioned that it's possible to name ranges instead

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.154
of referencing them by column and row addresses.

00:00:10.154 --> 00:00:13.410
To demonstrate the usefulness of named ranges,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.054
we'll go back to the fruit stand spreadsheet.

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:21.929
I've changed it a bit with formatting and I've given it dates instead of order numbers.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.155
There are four different fruits for sale at the fruit stand,

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:28.464
and likewise for item prices.

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:32.835
I've also chosen names I want to use for the prices in my formulas.

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:36.780
I've chosen Apple price, Orange price, etc.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.789
because that's more descriptive than

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.359
simply apple or orange for the name ranges I am going to create.

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:49.320
The basic method to name a cell or range is to select the cell or range.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.770
I'm going to select the cell with apple price in it,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.875
and then go to the formula menu and click define name.

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:58.369
I have a place to type in the name I want to use,

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:00.649
but Excel has already assumed I will want to use

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.859
the text from the adjacent cell to be my label.

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.879
Excel also shows the range address that will be named.

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:11.239
It includes the sheet name followed by an exclamation point,

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:13.429
followed by the absolute address.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.555
That's what we want here,

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:18.200
so I'll just accept it with an OK. Now I have

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.609
a cell that I can reference not only by its column and row which still works,

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.730
but by the name apple price.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.240
If I select that cell it even shows up in the name box over here on

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:33.454
the left to confirm that this cell is named, apple price.

00:01:33.454 --> 00:01:35.149
For the other prices,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.555
I can repeat the process.

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:41.290
But in Excel there's a better way which I'll use for the remaining prices.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.234
Select the name and price cells,

00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:47.689
go to the formula menu and click on Create from selection.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.049
A dialog pops up and excel once

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.105
again has assumed I want to use the left column for the name,

00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:56.450
so I'll say OK. Now,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.990
all the price cells have names and we can see them in the name box.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:05.884
When we created our income calculation for the fruit stand before,

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:11.064
we went through the task of setting the prices as absolutes when creating the formula.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:16.384
Here it is and it's long and it's pretty hard to tell exactly what's going on.

00:02:16.384 --> 00:02:19.699
I'm going to rewrite the formula using named ranges.

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:24.429
Again, we have the number of apples times the price which is apple price.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.705
I just start typing and when it appears,

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:28.910
press tab to autocomplete.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.949
I'll continue with each until I have them all in the formula.

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:36.229
There, that's much more readable.

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:43.000
I can see at a glance what this formula is doing and I'll just fill it down.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.044
That was one used for named ranges,

00:02:45.044 --> 00:02:50.000
identifying some single values by name that we went to use in formulas.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.840
Named ranges are also useful for naming a larger range

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.000
to use for lookups and we'll see how to do that next.
