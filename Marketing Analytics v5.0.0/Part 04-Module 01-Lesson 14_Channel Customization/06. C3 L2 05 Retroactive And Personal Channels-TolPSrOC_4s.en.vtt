00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.384
The custom channels that we defined,

00:00:02.384 --> 00:00:04.379
and the edits that we made to

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:09.824
predefined channels in the last sections would not be retroactive.

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:11.429
There are two types of

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.614
retroactive channel groupings that we can define in Google Analytics.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.559
A view level channel grouping would require edit access,

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.964
whereas a Google Analytics user level channel grouping

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:26.429
would only require read and analyze access.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.295
To define a channel grouping at

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:33.255
the view level that everyone who access the view could see,

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:35.830
we could click into Channel Grouping,

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.524
and now we would click New Channel Grouping,

00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:42.604
and here's where we would start the process of defining a channel grouping

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:47.604
at the view level that all users could apply when accessing the view.

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:51.709
To look at defining a channel grouping at the user level,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.814
let's go over to the Google Merchandise Store account.

00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:58.429
Let's say that you managed analytics for Google Merchandise Store,

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:04.099
and you wanted to break out traffic from mall.googleplex.com as its own channel.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:09.189
No problem, we could definitely do that retroactively with a new channel grouping.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:15.120
Click into admin, and now instead of clicking the Channel Grouping Settings on top,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.204
in the view admin, we'd click Custom Channel Grouping.

00:01:18.204 --> 00:01:22.579
Since this channel grouping is in the personal tools and asset section of

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.079
the view admin it does only require read and analyze access,

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.039
and would only be accessible to the user who created it.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.125
Let's click New Channel Grouping here.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:37.805
Notice that when we begin to create the channel grouping it is empty.

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:40.160
You have a blank slate to start with.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.659
But what's considered to be normal practice is to recreate

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.435
the nine default channels and then create customizations on top of those nine channels.

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:55.715
Fortunately, we don't have to manually recreate all of these channel definitions.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:58.189
Google Analytics does provide a shortcut.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.399
If we click "Define a new channel",

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.695
and let's say that we wanted to create the email channel.

00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:08.419
We could select, System Defined Channel matches,

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:14.839
Email, and notice the nine default channels are available as options from this dropdown.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.500
So we do have to recreate the nine channels if that's what we choose,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.819
but we do not have to define the channels at a granular level.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.364
The definitions are encapsulated in these system defined channels.

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:31.670
I'm going to go ahead now and recreate the other eight channels.

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:37.699
Since there is not overlap between the definitions of the nine default channels,

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.644
the order of the channels actually does not matter in this case.

00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:45.920
So now that we have recreated the nine default channels,

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.914
we can start with our customizations.

00:02:47.914 --> 00:02:53.674
In this case, we're just going to be adding one new channel for mall.googleplex.com.

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:55.435
We'll click Define New Channel,

00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:58.694
call the new channel Googleplex Mall.

00:02:58.694 --> 00:03:03.974
Source exactly matches mail.googleplex.com.

00:03:03.974 --> 00:03:08.060
Now, of course, it is important in this case that

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.439
this channel definition appear before the referral definition or

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.879
else the mall.googleplex.com traffic would match

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.969
the referral definition and the session would never

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.300
reach the Googleplex Mall channel definition.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.935
Click Done. Let's call this channel grouping Default and Googleplex Mall.

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:32.090
Click Save. Now let's check this new channel grouping out in our reports.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.375
We'll go to Acquisition, All Traffic Channels,

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:40.870
and note that we can now apply the Default and Googleplex Mall Channel Grouping,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.340
and also another channel grouping that was defined for us at the View level.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.000
But let's go ahead and apply our Googleplex Mall Channel Grouping,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.139
and now we see Googleplex Mall broken out retroactively.

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.789
Similarly, if we went to the Multi-Channel Funnel reports,

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:02.229
which Patrick is going to be discussing in an upcoming lesson,

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:05.639
we see that the Default and Googleplex Mall Channel Grouping

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.149
that we defined is available,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.140
as well as the other channel grouping that was defined for us at the View level.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.074
If we go ahead and apply the Googleplex Mall Channel Grouping,

00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:18.795
we see in fact Googleplex Mall broken out.

00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:23.420
Also if we check out the model comparison tool in the Attribution section,

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.675
which Patrick will also be discussing in an upcoming lesson,

00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:30.485
we see our channel groupings available here as well.

00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:34.340
Now I myself do not have edit rights

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:37.984
to any of the views within the Google Merchandise Store account.

00:04:37.985 --> 00:04:44.600
So, I have recreated the Default and Googleplex Mall Channel Grouping in a test account,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.865
where I do have edit access.

00:04:46.865 --> 00:04:52.400
Because if I do have edit access what I can do is promote the channel.

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:58.294
What this means is that this personal channel now becomes a view-level channel,

00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:03.740
that anyone accessing the view can apply in any of the reports that we just reviewed.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.829
Between the Default Channel Grouping and

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:11.724
the View-level and Individual-user Channel groupings that we've seen in this section,

00:05:11.725 --> 00:05:16.205
it can get a little complicated to keep track of what applies where.

00:05:16.204 --> 00:05:19.490
This table summarizes that information.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.545
As a final thought,

00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:24.230
the New Channel Groupings that we can create at

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.064
the View-level and at the GA-User-level are certainly very useful,

00:05:29.064 --> 00:05:31.805
especially because they are retroactive.

00:05:31.805 --> 00:05:35.150
But they are not considered replacements for customizing

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:37.459
the Default Channel Grouping in the way that makes

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:40.829
the most sense for you and for your organization,

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:43.149
because there are situations in which

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:46.959
the alternative retroactive channel groupings don't apply.

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:50.829
So, make sure that you do customize your default channel grouping,

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:53.509
however, it makes the most sense for you.

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.714
As another final note,

00:05:55.714 --> 00:05:58.929
even after you customize the default channel grouping,

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.115
you don't necessarily have to rename it from Default Channel Grouping

00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:05.860
because it still is the default channel grouping

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.514
that appears in your reports as the default,

00:06:08.514 --> 00:06:14.089
and is available as the default in other contexts even when you have customized it.

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:16.924
So, it is default in multiple ways,

00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:20.245
so it's okay to leave the name as Default Channel Grouping,

00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:23.780
although you are, of course, free to change the name.
