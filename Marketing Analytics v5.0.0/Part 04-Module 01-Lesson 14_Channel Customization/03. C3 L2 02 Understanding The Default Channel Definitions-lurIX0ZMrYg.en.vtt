00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.314
Before we begin talking about channel customization,

00:00:03.314 --> 00:00:06.644
let's look at the source medium report and the channels report.

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:09.539
We're back into Google merchandise store demo account.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:14.279
All Google Analytics sessions that are recorded in the property and that are not

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:19.634
filtered out at the view level are accounted for in the source medium report.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:22.620
If we navigate to the channels report,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.414
all of the same sessions appear in the channels report.

00:00:26.414 --> 00:00:29.969
However, the channels report is designed to provide

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:35.609
a higher level slightly more human-readable classification of our traffic.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.784
How does Google Analytics map the source medium values to the channel values?

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:44.419
Let's consider an example of a click-through from AdWords,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.380
now known as Google Ads or from Bing Ads.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.675
For either of those click-throughs,

00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:53.209
if we do have auto tagging enable,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.524
the medium would be recorded as CPC.

00:00:56.524 --> 00:01:00.214
That would match the rule for the paid search channel.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:02.855
In the case of an email click-through,

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.465
if we've manually tagged our links or we've

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.689
automated campaign tagging in our email program,

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.944
the medium should be recorded as email.

00:01:11.944 --> 00:01:16.634
In this case, we would match the rule for the email channel.

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:19.525
But how do we know what these rules are?

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:24.520
There is a very important Google Analytics Help doc that we can refer to,

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.844
the default channel definitions.

00:01:26.844 --> 00:01:28.495
If we search for

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:33.564
Google Analytics default channel definitions and click through on the first result,

00:01:33.564 --> 00:01:38.185
we'll see the nine channels that your traffic can match by default.

00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:41.019
When we're reviewing these channel definitions,

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:44.780
there are some important considerations that we'll want to keep in mind.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.909
First, is that we can edit a default channel definition as needed.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.459
Also, very importantly you can define your own custom channels as needed.

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:57.444
You do not have to stick with the nine default channels.

00:01:57.444 --> 00:02:00.500
Also, critically you can take

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.870
the campaign parameters that Patrick discussed in

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.329
the last lesson and you can make sure that

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.474
your campaign parameters are matching

00:02:07.474 --> 00:02:14.030
the default definitions or edited channel definitions or your own custom channels.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.310
Your campaign parameters and your channel definitions are going to work hand in hand.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.555
There are many good candidates for custom channels that you can define.

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:28.025
Paid social, redirects, QR codes,

00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:31.550
press releases, SMS marketing,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.219
push notifications in your browser,

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:38.060
push notifications for Mobile App Campaign Tracking,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.675
Click through some email signatures,

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:45.520
click throughs on display campaigns that are either remarketing or prospecting,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.310
RLSA, brand or generic paid search

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.710
click-throughs and several different types of YouTube Click-throughs.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.260
In this channels report,

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.414
we see paid social broken out as a separate channel.

00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:01.609
Paid social is a great candidate for its own channel

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.030
because it's really not like organic social click-throughs.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.724
It's really it's own thing.

00:03:06.724 --> 00:03:12.724
Let's remember again that we want to control both ends of clean acquisition data.

00:03:12.724 --> 00:03:15.724
We're going to define our own channels.

00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:18.469
Then, on an ongoing basis,

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:23.465
we're going to control the campaign parameters that feed into those channels.

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.164
In the case of paid social campaigns,

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:31.519
we can make sure to use paid dash social as UTM medium.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.520
If we go back to our default channel definitions,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:42.140
and we see which of these channels UTM underscore medium equals paid social would match,

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.009
the answer is it would match none of them,

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:47.539
and that's okay because that means that we have

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:51.079
the opportunity to define our own custom channel.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.530
We're back in our org test account specifically in the test view within the property.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.370
When we're editing the default channel grouping

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.800
that will affect what everyone else sees in the view.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.810
So, we don't want to edit

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.534
the default channel grouping directly in our main working view right away.

00:04:10.534 --> 00:04:14.704
We'll click into Channel Settings, channel grouping.

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:19.324
For right now we're actually not going to click on "New channel grouping."

00:04:19.324 --> 00:04:21.589
That seems like the most important call to

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:25.489
action but we're going to click into default channel grouping.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.165
Will click "Define a new channel."

00:04:28.165 --> 00:04:32.220
We'll call this channel Paid social.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.310
Our rule will be based on the medium value.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.045
Medium, exactly matches Paid social.

00:04:41.045 --> 00:04:45.754
You could let this channel run in your test view for a period of days.

00:04:45.754 --> 00:04:49.129
If the paid social channel is populating correctly,

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:53.105
you could create the same channel within your main view.

00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:57.410
Here are some of the candidates for custom channels that we saw previously.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.400
In most cases, the channel is going to be defined based on

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:05.689
the medium value that we provide in our campaign parameters.

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.509
In one case, the channel will be defined based on medium and source value.

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.844
You can define your own channels based on any number of dimensions.

00:05:15.845 --> 00:05:21.760
But usually, channels are defined based on medium or medium and source.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.089
As an important consideration,

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.079
when you're defining your channels,

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:31.550
make sure to add the more specific channel definitions to the top of the channels list.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.560
If we consider a custom channel definition for email signature that is

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.689
based on medium matching email and source matching signature,

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.745
we want to always keep in mind which channel is click-through would match first.

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:51.800
If we have the email channel defined before the email signature channel,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.750
that will not give us our desired result because this click-through would satisfy

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.629
the email channel definition and it would never

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.975
get to the email signature channel definition.

00:06:02.975 --> 00:06:07.385
All sessions appear only one time each within the channels report.

00:06:07.384 --> 00:06:11.185
Once a definition is satisfied, the matching stops.

00:06:11.185 --> 00:06:14.105
So, this is not the scenario that we would want.

00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:19.925
What we would want is the more specific channel definition to appear first in the list.

00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:23.795
In this case, the email signature channel would be matched.

00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:26.509
The matching would stop at that point and

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.930
our session would be recorded in the correct channel.
