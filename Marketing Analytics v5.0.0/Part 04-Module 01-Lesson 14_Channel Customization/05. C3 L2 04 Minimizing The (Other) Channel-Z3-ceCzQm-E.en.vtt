00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
We can't talk about channel cleanup without considering the other channel.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.099
The other channel really is not a channel.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.910
It's just a catch-all for any sessions that do not

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.019
match any of the default or custom channel definitions.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.989
Ideally, you want the other channel to be as close to zero as possible.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.629
In this case, we don't have

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:28.424
a huge number of sessions that are going into the other channel.

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:33.304
But there still are 0.75 percent of sessions that are ending up in other.

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:36.454
So, it's certainly enough for us to investigate.

00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:39.769
How are we going to clean out the other channel?

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.740
In some cases, we'll be able to change

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.980
the campaign parameters going forward to match one of

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.219
the channel definitions or we could potentially

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.774
deal with it within the channel definitions themselves.

00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:55.489
We can revise default channel definitions.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.820
We could revise custom channel definitions that we've already

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.390
created or we could create a new custom channel.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.590
If we add source medium as a secondary dimension

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.090
to the channels report and we filter on other for the primary dimension,

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.234
we start to see some of the culprits.

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:14.795
In the case of not set,

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:19.924
this means that UTM medium is not being passed with other campaign parameters.

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:23.944
We would probably just want to correct the campaign parameters themselves.

00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:25.549
What's going on here?

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.959
Why isn't the source medium value matching the paid search channel definition?

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.388
If we go back to our channel definitions,

00:01:32.388 --> 00:01:36.530
we see that the conditions for paid search are media matches regular

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.260
expression cpc or ppc or paid search all lowercase.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.875
Capital CPC would not match this rule.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:51.620
So, our two approaches could be to either change UTM medium to lowercase cpc

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.230
or if for some reason we could not change UTM medium to lowercase cpc,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.704
we would also have the choice to edit a default channel definition.

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:03.109
We'd be able to go into

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:08.330
the paid search default channel definition and add another condition defined rules,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.814
system define channel matches paid search or medium exactly matches uppercase CPC.

00:02:16.814 --> 00:02:22.115
There is a special note regarding our uppercase CPC medium value.

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:26.600
Even if we added a lowercase medium filter to our view,

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.474
this would not help channel matching.

00:02:28.474 --> 00:02:31.099
If we were lower casing the medium value,

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.555
this filter would be applied after channel matching has already occurred.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.930
In the case of prospecting as a medium,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.955
the prospecting channel that we set up in the previous example would actually capture

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:50.000
all of these sessions because one of the rules was medium exactly matches prospecting.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.564
In the case of medium equals survey,

00:02:52.564 --> 00:02:55.150
this seems like a specialized click-through.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.819
We'd also want to create a survey custom channel.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.814
Just to emphasize the overall procedure of channel customization and matching,

00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:09.175
remember that you control your channel customizations as an implementation step.

00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:12.800
Then, you can control your campaign parameters on

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.460
an ongoing basis to match the channels as needed.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.370
It's hard to overemphasize the benefits of

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.740
clean acquisition data on the campaigning and on the channel end.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.439
First, at a basic level,

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.939
it cleans up your acquisition reports.

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.759
Since you can apply the default channel grouping to

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:36.009
the multi-channel funnel reports that Patrick we'll discuss in an upcoming lesson,

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:41.149
we also get the benefit of clean acquisition data in the MCF reports.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.090
For any type of attribution modelling,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.245
clean acquisition data is going to be critical.

00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:52.490
Similarly, for any advanced analysis that involves acquisition data,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.400
the original data quality will be key.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.814
As we saw in a previous lesson,

00:03:57.814 --> 00:04:03.829
integration with other data sources including CRM data will help for analysis such as

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.719
customer lifetime value by

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:11.284
original marketing channel and also re-qualification by original marketing channel.

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:15.139
Now, Patrick and I have gone through a lot of detail about

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.844
campaign tracking and channel customization in the last two lessons.

00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:22.520
It's important to understand that there's not

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:26.629
one correct way to approach campaigns and channel customization.

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:30.259
But you do want to decide on a way that makes the most sense

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.115
for you and your stakeholders and to stick with it.

00:04:34.115 --> 00:04:36.620
There are very few organizations that

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.894
actually have a great handle on their acquisition data.

00:04:39.894 --> 00:04:44.719
So, if you can make sure to define the custom channels that make the most sense for

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.860
you and then maintain your campaign tracking on an ongoing basis in a coherent way,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.500
you're going to be in a great position for analysis and

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.430
optimization and you'll be at a competitive advantage.
