00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
In this lesson, we're going to explore one of

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.080
my favorite topics in Google Analytics; channel customization.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.884
We'll look at the default channel definitions,

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:12.734
we'll define our own custom channels,

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.429
we'll see how we can minimize

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.850
that other channel that usually appears in the channels report,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.630
and we'll also talk about retroactive and personal channels.
