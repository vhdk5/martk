00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.649
Let's go back to some of

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.269
our more specialized and potentially difficult candidates for custom channels.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.710
There are remarketing and prospecting display campaigns.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.460
There is RLSA, which is another form of remarketing,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.060
but specifically for search ads within Google Ads.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:22.739
There are brand and generic paid search channels that we can break out.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.274
There are YouTube remarketing,

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:28.529
instream and discovery campaigns.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.850
There are click-throughs from YouTube cards and YouTube end screens.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.085
Let's first consider remarketing as a custom channel.

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:40.535
A great custom channel to define, but a difficult one.

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:45.169
There are potentially a couple of challenges with defining a remarketing channel.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.265
First, if you're using Google Ads or YouTube remarketing,

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:54.880
your remarketing campaigns are recorded with the source medium value of Google cpc.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.120
Which would mean by default,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.384
your remarketing click-throughs would be matched to the paid search channel.

00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:05.719
Another potential challenge with your remarketing channel definition is that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:09.849
you may have remarketing that is not administered through Google Ads.

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:12.574
If we went into the AdWords campaigns report,

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:18.034
or the all campaigns report and we added source medium as a secondary dimension,

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:20.390
we would see in fact,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.230
that our AdWords remarketing campaigns are coming through with Google cpc,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.954
as the source medium value.

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:29.659
Again, the problem here is that

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.009
this source medium value would match the paid search channel definition.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.430
If that is specific enough for you, that's okay.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.480
But I know that I would want to break out remarketing as its own channel.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.185
But how are we going to define this remarketing channel?

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:47.900
We can't use source medium value as we

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.840
saw in the channel definitions in the last section.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.950
But since we can't control the names of our campaigns within AdWords,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.790
this will be the key.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.280
As long as we remember to include remarketing at

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.114
the beginning of our actual remarketing campaign names within AdWords,

00:02:04.114 --> 00:02:06.309
we'll have what we need to define a channel.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.784
We're back in the channel definition screen.

00:02:08.784 --> 00:02:13.764
In the Test view, we'll click new channel, Remarketing, Campaign,

00:02:13.764 --> 00:02:18.250
starts with remarketing or campaign starts

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.110
with remarketing with a small r. We could've also used a regular expression in this case.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.930
But what about our non-Google ads remarketing campaigns on networks such as AdRoll?

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.395
In that case, we're not using auto tagging.

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:35.710
We can define our own UTM medium value,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.180
and we would define that UTM medium value as remarketing.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.340
So, what we could do in this case is expand the remarketing channel definition.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.390
We'll add another or statement; or,

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.214
medium, exactly matches, remarketing.

00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:56.020
So now, we have a hybrid remarketing channel definition

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.320
that will pull in all of our remarketing campaigns.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.594
If we wanted to create a custom channel definition for prospecting,

00:03:03.594 --> 00:03:05.740
we could follow the same process.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.465
Make sure to include prospecting at the beginning of the campaign names in Google Ads,

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:18.400
and that would mean we could define the prospecting channel as campaign starts with

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.050
prospecting or campaign starts with prospecting

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.605
with a little p. If you are running prospect and campaigns on other networks,

00:03:27.604 --> 00:03:32.284
and you can use UTM medium equals prospecting on those networks

00:03:32.284 --> 00:03:37.719
or medium, exactly matches, prospecting.

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:44.960
Similarly, if we wanted to define a channel for our RLSA campaigns to find a new channel;

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.020
RLSA, campaign, starts with RLSA.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.805
We would need to make sure to begin all of our RLSA campaigns with

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:58.685
RLSA in the AdWords interface

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:01.930
and then we could define the channel within Google Analytics.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.159
Lets consider the special case of Brand Paid Search and Generic Paid Search.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.419
Google Analytics provides some help to us in defining these channels.

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.824
We'll click in to Manage Brand Terms.

00:04:13.824 --> 00:04:18.529
Let's say that you are working with the Acme Company and the Acme Company is

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:23.209
marketing a special combination hammer and wrench called the hammewrench.

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:26.704
So, enter acme as a brand term.

00:04:26.704 --> 00:04:32.594
We'll also enter URL variations and we'll enter hammewrench.

00:04:32.595 --> 00:04:37.100
Save the brand terms and we're automatically prompted to set up channels.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.660
We see the confirmation that

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.970
the Generic Paid Search and Brand Paid Search channels have been set up for us.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.075
Let's talk about custom channels for

00:04:45.074 --> 00:04:49.250
YouTube remarketing instream and discovery campaigns.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.939
YouTube campaigns are administered through AdWords.

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.475
Like other AdWords campaigns,

00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:59.285
they come through with the source medium value of Google cpc.

00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:04.745
So, if we did want to define a channel for any of these types of YouTube remarketing,

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:09.530
we could again make sure that we included an identifier in the beginning of

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.109
the campaign name within AdWords and

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.365
then we would have what we needed to define our channel.

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:19.269
So for instance in the case of YouTube discovery ads,

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:24.549
if we included YT Discovery at the beginning of all of our campaigns,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.420
we could go into our channel definitions to find

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.730
a new channel; YouTube discovery, campaign,

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.540
starts with YT Discovery and

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.170
you could enter any other additional conditions for case variations.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.990
Let's consider other types of custom channels within

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.535
Google Analytics that we could define for YouTube click-throughs.

00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:49.135
If you are a part of the YouTube Partner Program,

00:05:49.134 --> 00:05:51.939
you can include cards in your video to include

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:55.134
actions such as clicking through to your website.

00:05:55.134 --> 00:05:58.074
Same thing for end screens.

00:05:58.074 --> 00:06:03.170
In these cases, you would be able to control UTM medium and

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.049
UTM source because they're not administered

00:06:06.048 --> 00:06:09.504
through AdWords and they aren't governed by auto tagging.

00:06:09.504 --> 00:06:11.269
So, in these cases,

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:13.849
you would be able to define a custom channel,

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.695
the so-called normal way,

00:06:15.694 --> 00:06:19.159
just based on medium value and source value.
