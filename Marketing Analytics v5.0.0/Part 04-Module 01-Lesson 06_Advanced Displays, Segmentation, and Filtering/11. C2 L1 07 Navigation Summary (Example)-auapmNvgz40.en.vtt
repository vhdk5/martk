00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
The navigation summary lets you see what happens when users

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.410
start on a particular page where they go next and how they exit.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.455
You'll find the navigation summary in the Behavior tab,

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:13.455
Site Content, All Pages report.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:17.039
Click on Navigation Summary and select the page you want to focus

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.535
on using the drop down menu next to Current Selection.

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:22.530
Let's use the homepage.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.740
This menu also lets you see a list of your site pages

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.144
and the number of page views for each page.

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:33.204
Let's focus on the four gray boxes on the top of the display.

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:37.689
The two gray boxes on the left hand side tells you how the page was reached,

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:40.579
the arrows report the percentage of site users

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.909
who reached the site directly with entrances.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:50.029
You also see the percentage who come to the page via another page with previous pages.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.185
In this case, nearly 58 percent of users viewing the homepage reached the page directly,

00:00:56.185 --> 00:01:00.560
42 percent come from a previous page on the site.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.679
The two great boxes on the right hand side tell you what

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.620
happens when users leave the page.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.075
Exits reports the percent of users who leave the site entirely.

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:15.844
Next Pages report the percent who remain on the site and view another page.

00:01:15.844 --> 00:01:17.209
So, in this case,

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.899
a larger percentage of users continue on to another page of

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.760
the site 65.52 percent which is a good thing.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.310
For this site you want users to shop and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.445
click into product categories and pages on the site.

00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:35.119
It would be good to lower their percentage of exits month over month and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.760
increase the percentage of users who go on to other pages.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.344
Beneath the arrows are two columns,

00:01:42.344 --> 00:01:46.465
one labeled Previous Page Path and the other labeled Next Page Path.

00:01:46.465 --> 00:01:52.284
These columns provide the details on pages viewed prior to and after the target page.

00:01:52.284 --> 00:01:57.670
Keep in mind that these relative numbers will change as the target page is changed.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.620
So, the information shown in the left column beneath

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.950
previous page indicates that 12 percent of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.144
users who visit the homepage from another internal page

00:02:07.144 --> 00:02:10.745
arrive from the Shop By Brand YouTube page.

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:12.310
This isn't really striking,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.569
so let's see if there's something insightful in the next page path column.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.319
So, the right-hand column under the Next Page Path indicates that

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.439
the Google redesign apparel men's page

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.224
is the most frequently viewed page after the homepage,

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:31.370
20.69 percent of page views.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.450
So, it sounds like shopper behavior with some browsing going on,

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:41.314
but why would shoppers go to the YouTube Brand Page and then to the homepage?

00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:44.395
Why wouldn't they browse into the YouTube products?

00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:46.365
Do they land there by accident?

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.780
Let's make this the target page.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.604
Wow, now you see that this was an entrance page almost 80 percent of the time.

00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:57.949
That means it's the first page on the customer journey,

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:02.954
and 54 percent of those users exit, this is something.

00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:08.719
Let's make the homepage the current selection again and look at it to test a hunch.

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.539
You see the word redesign in the page URL,

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.454
so a change to the page must have been made.

00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:17.600
If you click on the link in the UI,

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.254
it will take you to the actual page.

00:03:20.254 --> 00:03:22.384
The page is not available,

00:03:22.384 --> 00:03:24.454
this is a major find.

00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:27.670
What is the source medium sending traffic to this page?

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:32.209
Is there a campaign driving traffic to this page or perhaps an old link?

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.510
This is something you can take action on right away.

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:39.049
You could use the landing pages report to see what

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.350
source medium is driving traffic to this page and address this issue,

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.919
but more importantly, the navigation summary

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.369
helped you find a high traffic page that is not available.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.740
Use the navigation summary to analyze how users interact with your pages

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.140
to improve processes and flows on your site and to enhance the customer journey.
