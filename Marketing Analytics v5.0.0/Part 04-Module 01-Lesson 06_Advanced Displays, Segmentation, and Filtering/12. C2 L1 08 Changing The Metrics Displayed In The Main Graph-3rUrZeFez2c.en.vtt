00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
Analyzing the performance of metrics over

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.710
various time periods is important for understanding trends and seasonality.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.279
The time graph in the Google Analytics Reporting Interface,

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.584
allows you to graph one or two metrics and see them visualized over time.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:18.225
Let's see this in the audience overview.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:24.570
By default, the top graph shows the number of users by day for the selected date range.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.905
The blue line shows the fluctuation in the user metric.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:32.429
If you place your cursor over any point on the line graph,

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.070
you'll see detailed information for that date.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.795
The data options on the right give you timing options.

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:40.414
You can select hourly,

00:00:40.414 --> 00:00:43.384
by day, by week, or by month.

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:47.914
Users is not the only metric you can see in the Line graph,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:53.164
you can use the drop-down to chart any of the available metrics in this data-set.

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:55.534
Let's choose sessions.

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:58.744
Now we see sessions by day.

00:00:58.744 --> 00:01:01.954
You can also chart more than one metric at a time,

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:05.149
by clicking on the, Select a Metric Link.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.575
This brings up the remaining metrics for the audience dataset.

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:12.030
Let's add bounce rate.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.730
Now, the chart is showing sessions and bounce rate over time.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.450
You'll note that each metric is presented in a different shade,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.454
and the scales for each metric are on opposite sides of the chart.

00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:28.909
The scale for the first variable sessions, is on the left.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.000
The scale for bounce rate is on the right.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.635
Just like before, you can place your cursor over any specific date,

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:40.700
to bring up the data for both metrics, for the date shown.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.500
You can also compare metrics across two different time periods.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.790
Use the data selector to select the date ranges.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.609
Here you see we selected January 1,

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.590
2018 through March 31,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.204
2018, as our first date range.

00:01:57.204 --> 00:02:02.299
We're comparing it to the previous year aligned by the day of the week.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.134
Now, you see data displayed for each date range in the graph.

00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:10.250
As before, you can place your cursor over

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.330
a selected date range and see data for a particular day,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.240
and compare it to the same day last year,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.040
aligned by the day of the week.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.319
The time graph can help you understand

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.680
seasonality and identify changes in metrics quickly.
