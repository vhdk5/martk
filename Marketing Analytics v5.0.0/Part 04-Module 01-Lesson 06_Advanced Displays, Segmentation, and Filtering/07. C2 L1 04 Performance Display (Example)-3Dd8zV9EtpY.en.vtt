00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
Their performance display features

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:06.765
a horizontal bar chart to help you understand your data at a glance.

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:11.759
Bar charts show discrete numerical comparisons across categories.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.119
Let's use this display in the AdWords keywords report,

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.899
to analyze the most popular incoming paid keywords.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:21.059
This display is already selected and

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:24.945
the secondary dimension keyword match type is added here.

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:27.838
Results with values that were not set,

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:32.640
are filtered out to focus the analysis on available keywords and match types.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.414
Looking at the Ecommerce metric group,

00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:38.939
you see the top two keywords driving traffic to the site.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:42.174
Google merchandise store and Google merchandise.

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:45.904
You can see data for sessions and transactions.

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:48.410
The keyword Google merchandise store,

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.389
drove the most sessions and the largest percentage of transactions,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.535
followed by the number two, Google merchandise.

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:57.649
But looking at the next few rows,

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.509
you can see the same keywords with

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:04.370
a different match type and the impact this has on sessions and transactions.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.140
Match types can have a major influence on AdWords account performance.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.545
They're one of the controls you use in your bid strategy.

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:17.680
Let's take a closer look at match types to understand what the data is telling us.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.720
Broad match is the default match type.

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.539
It's called broad because it allows your ad to match

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.270
the widest possible range of searches,

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:28.774
that are still somewhat related to your keyword.

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.920
Your ads will show for synonyms,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.409
related searches and other variations.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.609
Exact match is the most restrictive of the keyword match types.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.700
With this type, users only see your ad when they

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.215
type your exact keyword phrase by itself.

00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:49.130
Since broad matched ads are set up to reach the widest possible audience,

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:54.349
searchers might see and click your ad even when they're querying other topics.

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:57.140
These types of keywords can drive clicks,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.420
but you want to monitor them closely to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.969
make sure you're getting the best return on your investment.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.379
Back in the report,

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:08.164
you can change the metric group to clicks to view advertising metrics like click,

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:12.408
cost, click-through rate, cost-per-click and most importantly,

00:02:12.408 --> 00:02:13.969
return on ad spend.

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.259
Let's compare ROAS to sessions.

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.120
Looking at rows one and two,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.694
you see that Google merchandise store exact match is driving 26% of the traffic,

00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:29.780
but their return on ads spent is far greater for the Google merchandise keyword.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.044
In row five, Google merchandise store,

00:02:33.044 --> 00:02:36.359
broad match also has pretty high ROAS.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.800
We can learn even more about ad performance by segmenting by

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.555
device category which is another option for AdWords targeting.

00:02:43.555 --> 00:02:48.650
Segmenting on mobile reveals a drastic drop in ROAS for these keywords.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.870
If you view the desktop segment,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.145
the ROAS for our second keyword spikes even higher than before.

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:58.189
It's important to monitor keyword performance over

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.134
time to make sure these insights are statistically significant.

00:03:02.134 --> 00:03:03.709
As you do that,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.560
use the performance display to see comparisons across

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.129
categories and to spot optimization opportunities quickly.
