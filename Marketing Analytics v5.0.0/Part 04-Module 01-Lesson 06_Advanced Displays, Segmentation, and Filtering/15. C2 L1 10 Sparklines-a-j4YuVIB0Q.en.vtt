00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Sparklines are small graphics designed to give you

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.380
a quick representation of numerical or statistical information.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.785
Let's take a look at sparklines in the audience overview report.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:15.480
The audience overview report has sparklines for eight different metrics.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.335
Each sparkline is in the form of a graph without axis.

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:21.600
You can click on a sparkline for

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.140
a particular metric to see that metric represented in the time graph.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.195
Let's click on pageviews.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:32.149
Now, you can see that the metric in the main overtime graph has changed to pageviews,

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.850
and you can see that metric graphed over time.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.789
Sparklines can help you look at different metrics and spot trends very quickly.

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.174
Another report where you can see sparklines is the multi-channel funnels overview.

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:48.834
Here, you see sparklines for conversions,

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:52.649
click assisted conversions, impression assisted conversions,

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.600
and rich media assisted conversions.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.420
Sparklines are also visible in the behavior overview,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.000
goals overview, and e-commerce overview.
