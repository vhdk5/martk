00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
The comparison display uses a horizontal bar chart to let

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.814
you analyze relative performance for selected metrics.

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:11.835
Let's see how you can use this display in the source medium report.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:14.190
In this report, you can analyze the performance of

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:16.500
your traffic by source, like for example,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.414
a search engine like Google and medium the category of the traffic,

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:23.039
organic, cost-per-click or referral.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.820
We're looking at the summary metric group in the performance display,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.204
and you see sessions and bounces.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:33.954
You can see that Google Organic drove the most traffic to the site for this day range,

00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:37.445
and the percentage of bounces for this source medium is high.

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:41.719
This is useful information but not particularly insightful.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.689
You need to know more to really evaluate performance.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.364
So, let's switch to the comparison display.

00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:49.755
Looking at sessions and bounce rate,

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:53.359
you can now see the bounce rate compared to the site average.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.604
Values in red and to the right are performing worse than average.

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:01.614
Values in green and to the left are performing better than average.

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:07.504
In row four, traffic referred from mail.googleplex.com is much better than average.

00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:09.949
But keep in mind, we're looking at bounce rate here.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.564
So, the negative 69.95 is positive.

00:01:13.564 --> 00:01:16.099
It looks like traffic from the referral medium is

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:19.155
performing best in terms of the bounce rate metric.

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:21.454
Maybe we need to look at landing pages for

00:01:21.454 --> 00:01:24.814
other traffic sources and mediums to see why our visitors are bouncing.

00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:26.989
You can learn more about your traffic by adding

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:30.469
a secondary dimension like device category or CD.

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.775
You could also explore other metrics using the comparison display.

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:39.140
Understanding this report display and how it works will help you research and answer

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.090
specific questions and find data that is actionable and useful.
