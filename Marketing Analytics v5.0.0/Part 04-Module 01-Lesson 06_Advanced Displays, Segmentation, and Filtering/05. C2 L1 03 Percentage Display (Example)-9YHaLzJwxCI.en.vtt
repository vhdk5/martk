00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
The percentage display lets you see your data in

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.804
a pie chart to show numerical proportion.

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:11.519
This type of data visualization is useful for identifying the parts of a whole quickly.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.179
Let's use this display in the product performance report to see

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.795
how visitors are interacting with and purchasing products.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.540
This report is an enhanced e-commerce report in

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.320
the conversion section of the Google Analytics reporting interface.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.210
You'll only see it in your account if you've implemented enhanced e-commerce.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.789
First, select the percentage display to change the way the display looks.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.850
Next, select the shopping behavior metric

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.300
group to analyze how visitors are interacting with products.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:48.289
Let's change the primary dimension to product category to focus our analysis a bit.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.079
Change the metric to product detail views in both dropdowns.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.364
This metric tells us the number of times a product detail page was viewed.

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:04.159
In the report, the home shot by brand YouTube product category

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.004
has the largest percentage of product detail views, 16.9 percent.

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.390
The pie chart makes that very clear.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.000
If we look at the site for the Google merchandise store,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.295
you can see precisely what this means.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:18.980
On the homepage is main navigation menu,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.615
you can shop by brand and YouTube is one of the options in the dropdown.

00:01:23.614 --> 00:01:26.879
Each YouTube product has a detail page.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:29.464
You can click for more information.

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:34.055
So we know that YouTube branded products had the most detailed views.

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:36.535
Can the same be said about checkouts?

00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:39.905
Let's go back to our report to answer that question.

00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:44.885
Change the metric here to product checkouts in both dropdowns.

00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:47.750
So the answer to that question is no.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.504
Apparel has a greater share of product checkouts.

00:01:51.504 --> 00:01:53.784
Another important question is,

00:01:53.784 --> 00:01:57.979
which product category generated the most revenue for the date range?

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.704
To answer that question,

00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:02.390
select the summary metric group.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.664
The Nest-USA category generated 45 percent of their revenue during this date range.

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:15.294
So even though YouTube products had the most views and Apparel had the most checkouts,

00:02:15.294 --> 00:02:18.659
Nest-USA products generated the most revenue.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:24.424
You can click on the Nest-USA primary dimension to see a breakdown by product.

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:27.110
The percentage display makes it easy to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.590
identify the parts of the whole quickly using a pie chart.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.080
Use this display when you want to analyze a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.010
data set that has a limited number of categories.
