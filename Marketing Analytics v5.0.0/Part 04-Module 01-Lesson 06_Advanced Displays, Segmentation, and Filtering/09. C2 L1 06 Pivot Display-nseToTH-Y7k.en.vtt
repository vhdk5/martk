00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
The pivot display lets you rearrange data in a table for very detailed analysis.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.070
You can pivot your data by a secondary dimension to

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.054
explore very specific business questions.

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:13.304
Let's see it in the source medium report.

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:16.754
Select the pivot display in the reporting interface,

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:18.585
add your pivot metrics,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.460
sessions and bounce rate.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.045
You see sessions and bounce rate by source medium.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:28.605
Let's say you want to explore this traffic and bounce by state.

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:30.964
Let's pivot by region.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:34.549
A user's region is derived from their IP addresses or you

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:38.719
can upload geographical IDs to make it match your business data.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.265
In the US, a region is a state like California, for example.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:44.570
In the first column,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.325
you see the total sessions and bounce rate by the source medium as before.

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:52.645
But the other columns break the data down by state.

00:00:52.645 --> 00:01:00.430
You see 62,805 sessions in California with a bounce rate of 31.71 percent,

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.034
compared to 14,824 sessions from New York,

00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:08.599
with the bounce rate of 35.49 percent.

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:12.559
There's a region here that is not set in column four.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.439
This could mean the IP address may not be shared by

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.250
the visitor which could happen for several different reasons.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.015
If you wanted to explore this data by device category,

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.010
you could add a secondary dimension,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.910
this display to get even more specific.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.280
Now, you see desktop sessions and bounce rate from

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.030
California versus mobile sessions and bounce rate,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.060
and you can do the same analysis for other regions.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.299
The pivot display lets you interact with your data and

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.719
layer on dimensions for very specific analysis.

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.489
Use this display in Google Analytics to help you find insights fast.
