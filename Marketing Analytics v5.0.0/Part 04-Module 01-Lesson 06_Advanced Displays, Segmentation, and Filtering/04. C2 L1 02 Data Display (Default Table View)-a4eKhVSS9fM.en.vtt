00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
The data display is the default display in many standard Google Analytics reports.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.910
The data is shown in a table and grouped by primary dimension.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.630
You can isolate the data by metric group in this report.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.780
Let's say you want to know the number of visitors you had to your site,

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.710
and the number of purchases that took place during the selected time period.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.900
Looking at the channels report,

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:27.149
you'll see there are metrics in the table for acquisition behavior and conversion.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.619
This is great information,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.350
but we can reduce the noise in this report a bit.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.380
The question word discussing is about purchases on the site.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.460
So, you can select the Ecommerce metric group in

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.965
the Explorer tab to focus on Ecommerce metrics.

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:44.930
Now, it's easier to see that the channel

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.875
associated with the most transactions is the referral channel.

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:53.409
The primary dimension in the report is the default channel grouping.

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.000
You cannot change the primary dimension to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.990
source to see transactions displayed by source.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.410
Now, you can see the number of transactions and

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.284
the exact referral source associated with the transactions.

00:01:07.284 --> 00:01:10.744
To sort the number of transactions from high to low,

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:13.055
click on the Transaction column.

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:15.950
If you want to search for a particular source,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.564
you can use the search box to type in that value.

00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:25.564
There's also an advanced search feature that allows you to define a more granular search.

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:31.655
One unique feature of the data display is a dimension metric pop-up.

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:34.670
Hover over the question mark icon in

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.469
a column label to see a definition of that metric or dimension.

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.140
This feature helps you understand precisely how

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.590
each metric and dimension is defined in Google Analytics.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.265
Learning these definitions will help you understand the data,

00:01:49.265 --> 00:01:51.359
and present it more effectively.
