00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
In some cases, when you're doing analysis,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.070
you'll want to drill down into specific metrics and

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.730
dimensions and analyze trends in your data over time.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.425
The plot rows feature and the motion chart display will help you do just that.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:16.890
Let's see how these features work in the all channels report.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.155
Let's say you want to analyze user trends for display, referral and direct.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:27.929
You can plot these dimensions on the main time graph in the reporting interface.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.564
The blue line is the aggregate data for total users.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.530
It stays on the graph display,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.920
causing the other rows we plotted to get lost.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.500
The motion charts display can help us get around this issue.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.549
There are three types of motion charts: dot based,

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:48.769
bar based and line based.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.190
As a note, you have to enable flash in your browser to see the motion chart display.

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:59.659
The dot based display will show you the metrics for the rows we plotted as colored dots.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.159
When you press play,

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.619
you'll see the data animated over time,

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.905
adding time as another dimension in the graph.

00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:12.049
The line chart removes the motion capability but you can use it

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.259
to solve the row plotting issue by isolating the data you want to analyze.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.115
Re-select the same metric users and select the dimensions,

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:27.574
display, referral and direct You can now see the distinction.

00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:31.350
You're also seeing the data that wasn't selected though;

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:34.640
social, paid and affiliates. Let's fix that.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.180
Select the Settings icon and move the opacity of

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.760
deselected items to zero percent to remove the deselected items.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.150
Now, you're left with a nice clean representation of the rows.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.670
In some instances, you may need to change

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.420
the scale to make the visual differentiation more clear.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.370
Let's say, for example, you needed to plot rows with values that cover a large range.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.975
We'll use Organic Search,

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:02.869
Paid Search and Affiliates as an example.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.925
Even in the line chart, with motion charts,

00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:09.919
the smaller dimensional plots are dwarfed by the larger one.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:16.144
The good news is, you can change the scale from linear to logarithmic in the pop-up menu.

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:17.960
On a logarithmic scale,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.240
each tick mark on the scale is the previous tick mark multiplied by some other number.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.950
In this case, each point in the scale is multiplied by 10.

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:32.449
Now, you can see a different row distribution where this first section is zero to 10.

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.969
The next one goes from 10 to a 100 and then a 100 to a 1,000.

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.099
The metric values don't change,

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.750
only the visualization of the values change.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.110
Both linear and logarithmic distributions are equally

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.495
accurate and you can choose the one that fits the needs for your visualization.

00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:52.789
The plot rows feature and the motion chart display

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:56.789
can help you when you need to do impromptu analysis.
