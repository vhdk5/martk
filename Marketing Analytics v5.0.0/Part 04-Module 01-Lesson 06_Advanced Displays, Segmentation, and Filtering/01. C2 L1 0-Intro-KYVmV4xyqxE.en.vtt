00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Now that some of the hard work of learning how to install

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.950
the Google Analytics code using Google Tag Manager is behind us,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.435
let's go back to studying the core building blocks of Google Analytics.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:15.300
In this course, we'll take a closer look at

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.635
the different types of data displays the Google Analytics interface offers.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:23.730
You will learn more about the distinction between metrics and dimensions,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.490
and how to apply filters to your data.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.339
We will delve into the power of segments,

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.634
audiences, and how Google measures time.

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:35.390
We will also learn how to create different views in

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.090
your account and how to manage the settings and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.790
permissions on Google Analytics to give the right

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.134
people in your organization access to the data.

00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:48.634
But first, let's learn about the different data displays in Google Analytics,

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.750
and let's take a closer look at

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.280
how different data visualizations can help you generate insights and take action.
